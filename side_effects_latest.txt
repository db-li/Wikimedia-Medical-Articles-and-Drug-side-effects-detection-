{{See also|Anabolic steroid#Adverse effects}}

[[Adverse effect]]s of androstanolone are similar to those of other AAS and include [[androgen]]ic side effects like [[oily skin]], [[acne]], [[seborrhea]], increased [[facial hair|facial]]/[[body hair]] [[hair growth|growth]], [[pattern hair loss|scalp hair loss]], and increased [[aggressiveness]] and [[sex drive]]. In women, androstanolone can cause partially irreversible [[virilization]], for instance [[voice deepening]], [[hirsutism]], [[clitoromegaly]], [[breast atrophy]], and [[muscle hypertrophy]], as well as [[menstrual irregularity|menstrual disturbance]]s and reversible [[infertility]]. In men, the drug may also cause [[hypogonadism]], [[testicular atrophy]], and reversible infertility at sufficiently high dosages.

Androstanolone can have adverse effects on the [[cardiovascular system]], especially with long-term administration of high dosages. AAS like androstanolone stimulate [[erythropoiesis]] ([[red blood cell]] production) and increase [[hematocrit]] levels and at high dosages can cause [[polycythemia]] (overproduction of red blood cells), which can greatly increase the risk of [[thrombosis|thrombic]] events such as [[embolism]] and [[stroke]]. Unlike many other AAS, androstanolone is not [[aromatase|aromatized]] and has no risk of [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]]ic side effects like [[gynecomastia]], [[water retention (medicine)|fluid retention]], or [[edema]]. In addition, as it is not a [[17α-alkylated anabolic steroid|17α-alkylated]] AAS and is administered parenterally, androstanolone has no risk of [[hepatotoxicity]].

{{Main article|List of side effects of tramadol}}
[[File:Side effects of Tramadol.png|thumb|280px|right|Main side effects of tramadol. Red color denotes more serious effects, requiring immediate contact with health provider.]]

The most common [[adverse effect]]s of tramadol include [[nausea]], [[dizziness]], [[Xerostomia|dry mouth]], [[indigestion]], abdominal pain, [[vertigo]], [[vomiting]], [[constipation]], drowsiness and [[headache]].

There are suggestions that chronic opioid administration may induce a state of [[immune tolerance]], although tramadol, in contrast to typical opioids, may enhance immune function. Tramadol withdrawal typically lasts longer than that of other opioids. Seven days or more of acute withdrawal symptoms can occur as opposed to typically three or four days for other codeine analogues.

However, according to a 2014 report by the World Health Organizations Expert Committee on Drug Dependence '&quot;....in many cases of tramadol dependence, a history of substance abuse is present....''but''....the evidence for physical dependence was considered minimal. Consequently, Tramadol is generally considered as a drug with low potential for dependence. In a recent German study (including a literature study, an analysis of two drug safety databases, and questionnaires analyses), the low abuse and low dependence potential of Tramadol were re-confirmed. The German expert group found a low prevalence of abuse or dependence in clinical practice in Germany, and concluded that Tramadol has a low potential for misuse, abuse, and dependence in Germany”.

Because of the possibility of [[convulsion]]s at high doses for some users, recreational use can be very dangerous. Tramadol can cause a higher incidence of [[nausea]], dizziness, loss of appetite compared with opioids, which could deter recreational use. Compared to hydrocodone, fewer persons choose to use tramadol recreationally.

Cefoperazone contains an ''N''-methylthiotetrazole (NMTT or 1-MTT) [[side chain]]. As the antibiotic is broken down in the body, it releases free NMTT, which can cause [[hypoprothrombinemia]] (likely due to [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibition]] of the [[enzyme]] [[vitamin K epoxide reductase]]) and a reaction with ethanol similar to that produced by [[disulfiram]] (Antabuse), due to inhibition of [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]].

Rasburicase administration can cause [[anaphylaxis]] (incidence unknown); [[methemoglobinemia]] may occur in susceptible individuals such as those with [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency|G6PDH deficiency]] due to the production of hydrogen peroxide in the urate oxidase reaction. Testing patients for G6PDH deficiency prior to starting a course of rasburicase has been recommended.

Common side effects (in more than 10% of patients) in clinical trials were diarrhoea, [[nausea]], and, unsurprisingly, [[hypoglycaemia]] (low blood [[glucose]] levels) and reactions at the injection site. [[Upper respiratory tract infection]]s were also common, but only slightly more so than under [[placebo]]. Uncommon but potentially severe side effects included acute [[pancreatitis]] (in 0.3% of patients) and [[hypersensitivity]] reactions (in fewer than 0.1%).

After long-term use for treating chronic conditions, tolerance may develop in patients, reducing its effectiveness.  The mechanisms of [[nitrate tolerance]] have been thoroughly investigated in the last 30 years and several hypotheses have been proposed. These include: 
#  Severe allergic reactions (rash; hives; itching; difficulty breathing; tightness in the chest; swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue); fainting; fast or slow heartbeat; nausea; new or worsening chest pain; vomiting.
# Impaired biotransformation of ISDN to its active principle NO (or a NO-related species)
# Neurohormonal activation, causing sympathetic activation and release of vasoconstrictors such as endothelin and angiotensin II which counteract the vasodilation induced by ISDN
# Plasma volume expansion
# The oxidative stress hypothesis (proposed by Munzel et al. in 1995)

The last hypothesis might represent a unifying hypothesis, and an ISDN-induced inappropriate production of oxygen free radicals might induce a number of abnormalities which include the ones described above. 
Furthermore, nitrate tolerance is shown to be associated with vascular abnormalities which have the potential to worsen patients prognosis: these include endothelial and autonomic dysfunction.   
In the short run, ISDN can cause severe headaches, necessitating analgesic (very rarely up to morphine)  administration for relief of pain, as well as severe hypotension, and, in certain cases, bradycardia. This makes some physicians nervous and should prompt caution when starting nitrate administration.

The most common complaint about the drug is from users who report that it did not help them to sleep. Others reported that the drug caused them to be more awake.

Issues include [[sleepiness]] the next day and issues with driving.

There have been reports of people performing complex tasks (such as cooking and eating, making phone calls, driving, having sex) with little recollection of the events with the use of [[Hypnotic|hypnotics]] such as suvorexant.

===Contraindications===
This drug is not recommended in people with [[liver impairment]]. Suvorexant [[pregnancy]] category is currently classified as Category C. Based on animal testing, this medication may cause fetal harm during pregnancy and should only be given in pregnancy if the potential benefit justifies the potential harm to the fetus. Evidence is inconclusive about whether using this medication while [[breastfeeding]] puts the infant at risk of harm.

[[Adverse drug reaction]]s (ADRs) most commonly associated with loperamide are constipation (which occurs in 1.7–5.3% of users), dizziness (up to 1.4%), nausea (0.7–3.2%), and abdominal cramps (0.5–3.0%). Loperamide treatment is not used in symptomatic ''[[Clostridium difficile colitis|C. difficile]]'' infections, as it increases the risk of toxin retention and precipitation of [[toxic megacolon]].

Loperamide should be administered with caution to people with [[liver failure]] due to reduced [[first pass metabolism]]. Additionally, caution should be used when treating people with advanced [[human immunodeficiency virus|HIV]] as there have been cases of both viral and bacterial toxic megacolon. If abdominal distension is noted, therapy with loperamide should be discontinued.

Contraindications include, but not limited to: 
* Uncontrolled infections
*Known hypersensitivity to dexamethasone
* Cerebral malaria
*Systemic fungal infection
*Concurrent treatment with live virus vaccines (including [[smallpox]])

===Interactions===
Known drug interactions include: 
* Inducers of hepatic microsomal enzymes such as [[barbiturates]], [[phenytoin]], and [[rifampicin]] can reduce the half-life of dexamethasone.
* Cotreatment with oral contraceptives can increase its [[volume of distribution]].

    <title>Minocycline</title>

Minocycline may cause [[Abdominal pain|upset stomach]], [[diarrhea]], [[dizziness]], unsteadiness, [[somnolence|drowsiness]], [[mouth sores]], [[headache]] and [[vomiting]]. Minocycline increases [[photophobia|sensitivity to sunlight]]. Minocycline may affect the quality of sleep and rarely cause sleep disorders.

Minocycline, but not other tetracyclines, can cause ''vestibular disturbances'' with [[dizziness]], [[ataxia]], [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]] and [[tinnitus]]. These effects are again thought to be related to minocycline's greater penetration into the central nervous system. Vestibular side effects are much more common in women than in men, occurring in 50% to 70% of women receiving minocycline. As a result of the frequency of this bothersome side effect, minocycline is rarely used in female patients.

Symptoms of an allergic reaction include [[rash]], itching, swelling, severe dizziness, and trouble breathing. Minocycline has also been reported to very rarely cause [[idiopathic intracranial hypertension]] (pseudotumor cerebri), a side effect also more common in female patients, potentially leading to permanent vision damage.

Thyroid cancer has been reported in the post-marketing setting in association with minocycline products. When minocycline therapy is given over prolonged periods, monitoring for signs of thyroid cancer should be considered.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In 2009, the FDA added minocycline to its Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS); a list of medications under investigation by the FDA for potential safety issues. The AERS cites a potential link between the use of minocycline products and [[autoimmune disease]] in pediatric patients.

    <title>Fenoterol</title>

Fenoterol is a short-acting  agonist, which also stimulates [[Beta-1 adrenergic receptor| receptor]]s at doses above the recommended therapeutic doses. It was widely used in [[New Zealand]] in the early 1990s but withdrawn from that market because of its association with an excess number of deaths.

It is thought that the association of increased risk of death was because it was typically used in excessively large doses for severe acute asthma attacks in the absence of medical assistance. Instances were known of patients who had used up to 80 puffs before seeking medical attention. Both excessive prescribed doses and patient's excessive self-medication with β agonists in acute asthma not responding to usual doses, are now generally recognized as undesirable with all β agonist asthma inhalers.

    <title>Losartan</title>

In January 2014, the FDA issued a black box warning that losartan can cause fetal toxicity, and should be discontinued as soon as pregnancy is detected.

The most common side effects for losartan are upper respiratory infections or stuffy nose, dizziness, and back pain.

More serious side effects include low blood pressure and allergic reaction.

Losartan should not be taken by people who are diabetic and taking [[aliskiren]].

    <title>Mycophenolic acid</title>

Common [[adverse drug reaction]]s (≥1% of patients) associated with mycophenolate therapy include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, joint pain; infections, [[leukopenia]], and/or [[anemia]] reflect the immunosuppressive and [[myelosuppressive]] nature of the drug. Mycophenolate sodium is also commonly associated with fatigue, headache, cough and/or breathing issues. Intravenous (IV) administration of mycophenolate mofetil is also commonly associated with [[thrombophlebitis]] and [[thrombosis]]. Infrequent adverse effects (0.1–1% of patients) include [[esophagitis]], [[gastritis]], [[gastrointestinal tract]] [[hemorrhage]], and/or invasive [[cytomegalovirus]] (CMV) infection. More rarely, [[pulmonary fibrosis]] or various [[neoplasia]] occur: melanoma, lymphoma, other malignancies having an occurrences of 1 in 20 to 1 in 200, depending on the type, with neoplasia in the skin being the most common site. Several cases of [[pure red cell aplasia]] (PRCA) have also been reported.

The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has issued an alert that patients on mycophenolate mofetil and mycophenolic acid are at increased risk of opportunistic infections, such as activation of latent viral infections, including [[shingles]], other [[herpes]] infections, [[cytomegalovirus]], and [[BK virus]] associated nephropathy. In addition the FDA is investigating 16 patients that developed a rare neurological disease while taking the drug. This is a [[JC virus|viral]] infection known as [[progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy]]; it attacks the brain and is usually fatal.

Mycophenolic acid is associated with miscarriage and congenital malformations when used during pregnancy, and should be avoided whenever possible by women trying to conceive.

GI intolerance in about 10% of patients taking mycophenolate mofetil can be overcome largely by replacing it with mycophenolate sodium or azathioprine.{{Citation needed|date = November 2014}}

Among the most common effects of this drug is increased blood cholesterol levels. Other changes in blood chemistry such as [[hypomagnesemia]], [[hypocalcemia]], [[hyperkalemia]], and an increase in [[blood urea nitrogen]] (BUN) can occur.

    <title>Perphenazine</title>

As a member of the phenothiazine type of antipsychotics, perphenazine shares in general all allergic and toxic side-effects of [[chlorpromazine]].  A 2015 systematic review of the data on perphenazine conducted by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] concluded that &quot;there were no convincing differences between perphenazine and other antipsychotics&quot; in the incidence of adverse effects. Perphenazine causes early and late [[extrapyramidal side effect]]s more often than [[placebo]], and at a similar rate to other medium-potency antipsychotics and the atypical antipsychotic [[risperidone]].

When used for its strong [[antiemetic]] or [[antivertignosic]] effects in cases with associated brain injuries, it may obscure the clinical course and interferes with the diagnosis.  High doses of perphenazine can cause temporary dyskinesia.  As with other typical antipsychotics, permanent or lasting [[tardive dyskinesia]] is a risk.

Overdose of sumatriptan can cause [[sulfhemoglobinemia]], a rare condition in which the blood changes from red to green, due to the integration of [[sulfur]] into the [[hemoglobin]] molecule. If sumatriptan is discontinued, the condition reverses within a few weeks.

Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following the use of sumatriptan injection or tablets. Events reported have included [[coronary artery vasospasm]], transient myocardial ischemia, [[myocardial infarction]], [[ventricular tachycardia]], and ventricular fibrillation (V-Fib). {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The most common side effects reported by at least 2% of patients in controlled trials of sumatriptan (25-, 50-, and 100-mg tablets) for migraine are atypical sensations (paresthesias and warm/cold sensations) reported by 4% in the placebo group and 5–6% in the sumatriptan groups, pain and other pressure sensations (including chest pain) reported by 4% in the placebo group and 6–8% in the sumatriptan groups, neurological events ([[vertigo]]) reported by less than 1% in the placebo group and less than 1% to 2% in the sumatriptan groups. Malaise/fatigue occurred in less than 1% of the placebo group and 2–3% of the sumatriptan groups. Sleep disturbance occurred in less than 1% in the placebo group to 2% in the sumatriptan group.

The most prevalent side effects for cariprazine include [[akathisia]], [[insomnia]], and [[weight gain]]. Cariprazine does not appear to impact metabolic variables or prolactin levels, and unlike many other antipsychotics, does not increase the electrocardiogram (ECG) QT interval. In short term clinical trials extrapyramidal effects, sedation, akathisia, nausea, dizziness, vomiting, anxiety, and constipation were observed. One review characterized the frequency of these events as &quot;not greatly different from that seen in patient treated with placebo&quot; but a second called the incidence of movement-related disorders &quot;rather high&quot;.

Regarding side effects, the label of cariprazine states, &quot;The possibility of lenticular changes or cataracts cannot be excluded at this time.&quot;

Ganciclovir is commonly associated with a range of serious [[hematology|haematological]] adverse effects. Common [[adverse drug reaction]]s (≥1% of patients) include: [[granulocytopenia]], [[neutropenia]], [[anaemia]], [[thrombocytopenia]], fever, nausea, vomiting, [[dyspepsia]], diarrhea, abdominal pain, flatulence, anorexia, raised liver enzymes, headache, confusion, hallucination, seizures, pain and [[phlebitis]] at injection site (due to high pH), sweating, rash, itch, increased serum [[creatinine]] and blood [[urea]] concentrations.

===Toxicity===

Ganciclovir is considered a potential human [[carcinogen]], [[teratogen]], and [[mutagen]]. It is also considered likely to cause inhibition of [[spermatogenesis]]. Thus, it is used judiciously and handled as a [[cytotoxic drug]] in the clinical setting.

    <title>Rivastigmine</title>

Side effects may include nausea and vomiting, decreased appetite and weight loss.

The strong potency of rivastigmine, provided by its dual inhibitory mechanism, has been postulated to lead to more nausea and vomiting during the titration phase of oral rivastigmine treatment. This enforces the importance of taking oral forms of these drugs with food as prescribed.   However, rates of nausea and vomiting are markedly reduced with the once-daily rivastigmine patch (which can be applied at any time of the day, with or without food).
Patients and caregivers should be aware of warning signs of potential toxicities and know when to call their doctor. For the patch and oral formulations, skin rashes can occur at which time patients should contact their doctor immediately. For the patch, patients and caregivers should monitor for any intense itching, redness, swelling or blistering at the patch location. If this occurs, remove the patch, rinse the area and call the doctor immediately.

In a large clinical trial of the rivastigmine patch in 1,195 patients with Alzheimer's disease, the target dose of 9.5&amp;nbsp;mg/24-hour patch provided similar clinical effects (e.g. memory and thinking, activities of daily living, concentration) as the highest doses of rivastigmine capsules, but with one-third fewer reports of nausea and vomiting.

Usage of rivastigmine was associated with a higher frequency of reports of death as an adverse event in the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database compared to the other acetylcholinesterase inhibiting drugs donepezil and galantamine.

    <title>Cabergoline</title>

Side effects are mostly dose dependent. Much more severe side effects are reported for treatment of Parkinson's disease and (off-label treatment) for [[restless leg syndrome]] which both typically require very high doses. The side effects are considered mild when used for treatment of hyperprolactinemia and other endocrine disorders or gynecologic indications where the typical dose is one hundredth to one tenth that for Parkinson's disease.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Cabergoline requires slow dose titration (2–4 weeks for hyperprolactinemia, often much longer for other conditions) to minimise side effects. The extremely long bioavailability of the medication may complicate dosing regimens during titration and require particular precautions.

Cabergoline is considered the best tolerable option for hyperprolactinemia treatment although the newer and less tested [[quinagolide]] may offer similarly favourable side effect profile with quicker titration times.

Approximately 200 patients with newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease participated in a [[Clinical trial|clinical study]] of cabergoline monotherapy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Seventy-nine (79) percent reported at least one side effect. These side effects were chiefly mild or moderate:
* GI tract: Side effects were extremely frequent. Fifty-three percent of patients reported side effects.  Very frequent: [[Nausea]] (30%), [[constipation]] (22%), and dry mouth (10%). Frequent:  Gastric irritation (7%), [[vomiting]] (5%), and [[dyspepsia]] (2%).
* [[psychiatry|Psychiatric]] disturbances and [[central nervous system]] (CNS): Altogether 51 percent of patients were affected.  Very frequent: Sleep disturbances ([[somnolence]] 18%, [[insomnia]] 11%), [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]] (27%), and [[Clinical depression|depression]] (13%). Frequent: [[dyskinesia]] (4%) and [[hallucinations]] (4%).
* Cardiovascular: Approximately 30 percent of patients experienced side effects. Most frequent were hypotension (10%), peripheral [[edema]] (14%) and non-specific edema (2%). [[Arrhythmias]] were encountered in 4.8%, [[palpitations]] in 4.3%, and [[angina pectoris]] in 1.4%.

In a combination study with 2,000 patients also treated with levodopa, the incidence and severity of side effects was comparable to monotherapy. Encountered side effects required a termination of cabergoline treatment in 15% of patients. Additional side effects were infrequent cases of [[hematology|hematological]] side effects, and an occasional increase in liver [[enzymes]] or [[Blood serum|serum]] [[creatinine]] without [[Medical sign|sign]]s or [[symptoms]].

As with other ergot derivatives, [[pleuritis]], [[exudative]] pleura disease, pleura [[fibrosis]], [[lung]] fibrosis, and [[pericarditis]] are seen. These side effects are noted in less than 2% of patients. They require immediate termination of treatment. Clinical improvement and normalization of [[X-ray]] findings are normally seen soon after cabergoline [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]]. It appears that the dose typically used for treatment of hyperprolactinemia is too low to cause this type of side effects.

===Valvular heart disease===
In two studies published in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' on January 4, 2007, cabergoline was implicated along with [[pergolide]] in causing [[valvular heart disease]].  As a result of this, the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] removed pergolide from the U.S. market on March 29, 2007.  Since cabergoline is not approved in the U.S. for Parkinson's Disease, but for hyperprolactinemia, the drug remains on the market.  The lower doses required for treatment of hyperprolactinemia have been found to be '''not''' associated with clinically significant valvular heart disease or cardiac valve regurgitation.

    <title>Vincristine</title>

The main side effects of vincristine are [[chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy]], [[hyponatremia]], [[constipation]], and [[alopecia|hair loss]].

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy can be severe, and may be a reason to reduce or avoid using vincristine. The symptoms of this are progressive and enduring tingling numbness, pain and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes affecting the arms and legs. One of the first symptoms of peripheral neuropathy is [[foot drop]]: A person with a family history of foot drop and/or [[Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease]] (CMT) should avoid the taking of vincristine.

Accidental injection of vinca alkaloids into the spinal canal ([[intrathecal]] administration) is highly dangerous, with a mortality rate approaching 100 percent.  The medical literature documents cases of ascending [[paralysis]] due to massive [[encephalopathy]] and spinal nerve [[demyelination]], accompanied by intractable pain, almost uniformly leading to death.  Several patients have survived after aggressive and immediate intervention.   Rescue treatments consist of washout of the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] and administration of protective medications.
Children may do better following this injury.  One child, who was aggressively treated at the time of the injection, recovered almost completely with only mild neurological deficits.
A significant series of inadvertent intrathecal vincristine administration occurred in [[China]] in 2007 when batches of [[cytarabine]] and [[methotrexate]] (both often used intrathecally) manufactured by the company Shanghai Hualian were found to be contaminated with vincristine.

The overuse of vincristine may also lead to [[drug resistance]] by overexpression of the [[p-glycoprotein]] pump (Pgp). There is an attempt to overcome resistance by the addition of derivatives and substituents to the vincristine molecule.

This can lead to transient [[tumor]] activation with [[bone pain]] (in patients with [[cancer]] [[metastasis|metastases]]) and [[urinary retention]]. Side effects that occur later during the treatment are mainly due to [[hypogonadism|low sex hormone levels]] and include reduced [[libido]], [[erectile dysfunction]], [[hot flash]]es, [[vaginal dryness]], [[vaginal atrophy]], [[menorrhagia]], [[osteoporosis]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[asthenia]], [[emotional lability]], [[headache]], [[dizziness]], and application site reactions.

    <title>Tadalafil</title>

Tadalafil has been used in approximately 15,000 men participating in clinical trials, and over eight million men worldwide (primarily in the post-approval/post-marketing setting). The most common [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]] when using tadalafil are [[headache]], stomach discomfort or pain, indigestion, [[burping]], acid reflux, [[back pain]], [[Myalgia|muscle aches]], [[Flushing (physiology)|flushing]], and [[Nasal congestion|stuffy]] or [[Rhinorrhea|runny nose]]. These side effects reflect the ability of PDE5 inhibition to cause vasodilation (cause blood vessels to widen), and usually go away after a few hours. [[Back pain]] and muscle aches can occur 12 to 24 hours after taking the drug, and the symptom usually disappears after 48 hours.

In May 2005, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] found that tadalafil (along with other PDE5 inhibitors) was associated with vision impairment related to NAION ([[Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy|non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy]]) in certain patients taking these drugs in the post-marketing (outside of clinical trials) setting. Most, but not all, of these patients had underlying anatomic or vascular risk factors for development of NAION unrelated to PDE5 use, including: low cup to disc ratio (&quot;crowded disc&quot;), age over 50, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, [[hyperlipidemia]] and smoking. Given the small number of NAION events with PDE5 use (fewer than one in one million), the large number of users of PDE5 inhibitors (millions) and the fact that this event occurs in a similar population to those who do not take these medicines, the FDA concluded that they were not able to draw a cause and effect relationship, given these patients underlying vascular risk factors or anatomical defects. However, the label of all three PDE5 inhibitors was changed to alert clinicians to a possible association.

In October 2007, the FDA announced that the labeling for all PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, requires a more prominent warning of the potential risk of [[Hearing impairment|sudden hearing loss]] as the result of postmarketing reports of deafness associated with use of PDE5 inhibitors.

    <title>Tamoxifen</title>

A report in September 2009 from Health and Human Services' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality suggests that tamoxifen, raloxifene, and tibolone used to treat breast cancer significantly reduce invasive breast cancer in midlife and older women, but also increase the risk of adverse side effects.
 
Some cases of lower-limb lymphedema have been associated with the use of tamoxifen, due to the blood clots and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) that can be caused by this medication. Resolution of the blood clots or DVT is needed before lymphedema treatment can be initiated.
 
===Bone===
A beneficial side effect of tamoxifen is that it prevents bone loss by acting as an ER [[agonist]] (i.e., mimicking the effects of estrogen) in this cell type. Therefore, by inhibiting [[osteoclasts]], it prevents [[osteoporosis]]. When tamoxifen was launched as a drug, it was thought that tamoxifen would act as an ER antagonist in all tissue, including bone, and therefore it was feared that it would contribute to osteoporosis. It was therefore very surprising that the opposite effect was observed clinically. Hence tamoxifen's tissue selective action directly led to the formulation of the concept of SERMs. In contrast tamoxifen appears to be associated with bone loss in premenopausal women who continue to menstruate after adjuvant chemotherapy.

===Endometrial cancer===
Tamoxifen is a SERM. Even though it is an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] in breast tissue it acts as [[partial agonist]] on the [[endometrium]] and has been linked to [[endometrial cancer]] in some women. Therefore, endometrial changes, including cancer, are among tamoxifen's side effects. With time, risk of endometrial cancer may be doubled to quadrupled, which is a reason tamoxifen is typically only used for 5 years.

The [[American Cancer Society]] lists tamoxifen as a known [[carcinogen]], stating that it increases the risk of some types of uterine cancer while lowering the risk of breast cancer recurrence. The ACS states that its use should not be avoided in cases where the risk of breast cancer recurrence without the drug is higher than the risk of developing uterine cancer with the drug.

===Cardiovascular and metabolic===
Tamoxifen treatment of postmenopausal women is associated with beneficial effects on serum lipid profiles. However, long-term data from clinical trials have failed to demonstrate a cardioprotective effect. For some women, tamoxifen can cause a rapid increase in [[triglyceride]] concentration in the blood.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} In addition there is an increased risk of [[thromboembolism]] especially during and immediately after major surgery or periods of immobility. Tamoxifen is also a cause of [[fatty liver]], otherwise known as steatorrhoeic hepatosis or steatosis hepatis.

===Central nervous system===
Tamoxifen-treated breast cancer patients show evidence of reduced [[cognition]], a major side effect of tamoxifen, and [[semantic memory]] scores. However memory impairment in patients treated with tamoxifen was less severe compared with those treated with [[anastrozole]] (an [[aromatase inhibitor]]).

A significant number of tamoxifen-treated breast cancer patients experience a reduction of [[libido]].

===Premature growth plate fusion===
While tamoxifen has been shown to antagonize the actions of estrogen in tissues such as the breast, its effects in other tissues such as bones has not been documented fully. There have been studies done in mice showing tamoxifen mimic the effects of estrogen on bone metabolism and skeletal growth. Thus increasing the possibility of pre-mature bone fusion. This effect would be less of a concern in adults who have stopped growing.

    <title>Oxycodone</title>

[[File:Side effects of Oxycodone.png|thumb|right|Main [[adverse effect|side effects]] of oxycodone]]
Serious side effects of oxycodone include reduced sensitivity to pain (beyond the pain the drug is taken to reduce), [[euphoria]], [[anxiolysis]], feelings of [[relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]], and [[respiratory depression]]. Common side effects of oxycodone include [[constipation]] (23%), [[nausea]] (23%), [[vomiting]] (12%), [[somnolence]] (23%), [[dizziness]] (13%), [[pruritus|itching]] (13%), [[dry mouth]] (6%), and [[sweating]] (5%).

In high doses, [[overdose]]s, or in some persons not tolerant to opioids, oxycodone can cause [[shallow breathing]], [[bradycardia|slowed heart rate]], cold/clammy skin, [[apnea|pauses in breathing]], [[hypotension|low blood pressure]], [[miosis|constricted pupils]], [[circulatory collapse]], [[respiratory arrest]], and [[death]].

Oxycodone overdose has also been described to cause spinal cord infarction in high doses and ischemic damage to the brain, due to prolonged hypoxia from suppressed breathing.

[[Oxycodone/naloxone|Oxycodone in combination]] with [[naloxone]] in managed-release tablets, has been formulated to both deter abuse and reduce &quot;opioid-induced constipation&quot;.

===Dependence, addiction, and withdrawal===
{{main article|Opioid dependence}}
The risk of experiencing severe [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms is high if a patient has become physically dependent and discontinues oxycodone abruptly. Medically, when the drug has been taken regularly over an extended period, it is withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. People who regularly use oxycodone recreationally or at higher than prescribed doses are at even higher risk of severe withdrawal symptoms. The symptoms of oxycodone withdrawal, as with other opioids, may include &quot;[[anxiety]], [[panic attack]], [[nausea]], [[insomnia]], [[muscle pain]], [[muscle weakness]], [[fever]]s, and other [[Flu-like syndrome|flu-like symptoms]]&quot;.

Withdrawal symptoms have also been reported in newborns whose mothers had been either injecting or orally taking oxycodone during pregnancy.

===Hormone imbalance===
{{Main article|Opioid#Hormone imbalance}}
As with other opioids, chronic use of oxycodone (particularly with higher doses) often causes concurrent [[hypogonadism]] or [[hormone imbalance]].

Proguanil is generally well-tolerated and most people do not experience side effects. However, common side effects include abdominal pain, nausea, headache, and fever. Taking proguanil with food may lessen these side effects. Proguanil should not be taken by people with severe renal impairment, pregnant women, or women who are breastfeeding children less than 5&amp;nbsp;kg. There have also been reports of increased levels of liver enzymes, which may remain high for up to 4 weeks after completion of treatment.

Nausea is a common side effect of IV administration and less common in other modes. [[Antiemetics]] can be given prior to DHE to counteract the nausea. Risks and contraindications are similar to the triptans. DHE and triptans should never be taken within 24 hours of each other due to the potential for coronary artery vasospasm. DHE produces no dependence.

Common [[Adverse drug reaction|side effects]] include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, mild rashes, asymptomatic elevations in [[liver enzymes]], and [[fever]]. Uncommon side effects include fatigue and malaise, behavioral changes, [[paresthesias]] and seizures, muscle cramps, and nose bleeds. Rare but sometimes serious side effects include severe behavioral changes (including [[suicidal ideation|suicidal thoughts]]), [[angioedema]], [[erythema multiforme]], and [[hepatitis|liver problems]].

===FDA investigation===
In March 2008, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) announced that it would investigate whether mood changes and suicidal thoughts are possible side effects of drugs in this class, including the popular drug Singulair, which currently lists these side effects.

On June 12, 2009, the FDA concluded their review into the possibility of [[neuropsychiatric]] side effects with leukotriene modulator drugs. Although clinical trials only revealed an increased risk of [[insomnia]], [[post-marketing surveillance]] showed that the drugs are associated with a possible increase in [[suicide|suicidal]] behavior and other side effects such as [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]], [[aggression]], [[anxiousness]], [[dream]] abnormalities and [[hallucinations]], depression, [[irritability]], [[Psychomotor agitation|restlessness]], and [[tremor]].

The most frequently occurring adverse reactions (≥ 5% and greater than placebo) were nausea, headache, constipation, dizziness, insomnia, hot flush, hyperhydrosis, vomiting, palpitations, heart rate increase, dry mouth, and hypertension [FDA Savella prescribing information]. Milnacipran can have a significant impact on sexual functions, including both a decrease in sexual desire and ability{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; most papers indicate the opposite.|date=March 2015}}. Milnacipran can cause pain of the testicles in men.  The incidence of cardiovascular and [[anticholinergic]] side effects was significantly lower compared to [[Tricyclic antidepressant|TCA]]s as a controlled study with over 3,300 patients revealed. Elevation of [[liver enzymes]] without signs of symptomatic liver disease has been infrequent. Mood swing to [[mania]] has also been seen and dictates termination of treatment. In [[psychotic]] patients emergence of [[delirium]] has been noticed. Milnacipran has a low incidence of [[sedation]] but improves [[sleep]] (both duration and quality) in depressed patients. In [[Psychomotor agitation|agitated]] patients or those with [[suicidal]] thoughts additive sedative/anxiolytic treatment is usually indicated.

    <title>Opipramol</title>

Opipramol is a well-[[tolerability|tolerated]] drug and is said to produce fewer [[side effect]]s than [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs) and [[serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]] (SNRIs).

The frequently (≥1% to &lt;10%) reported adverse reactions with opipramol especially at the beginning of the treatment include [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[dry mouth]], blocked nose, [[hypotension]], and orthostatic dysregulation.

The adverse reactions reported occasionally(≥0.1% to &lt;1%) include [[dizziness]], [[stupor]], [[micturition]] disturbances, [[accommodation (eye)|accommodation disturbances]], [[tremor]], [[weight gain]], thirst, allergic skin reactions (rash, urticaria), abnormal [[ejaculation]], [[erectile dysfunction|erectile impotence]], [[constipation]], transient increases in liver enzyme activities, [[tachycardia]], and [[palpitation]]s.

Rarely (≥0.01% to &lt;0.1%) reported adverse reaction includes excitation, headache, paresthesia especially in elderly patients, [[psychomotor agitation|restlessness]], [[sweating]], [[sleep disorder|sleep disturbances]], [[edema]], [[galactorrhea]], urine blockage, [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], collapse conditions, stimulation conducting disturbances, intensification of present heart insufficiency, blood profile changes particularly [[leukopenia]], [[confusion]], [[delirium]], stomach complaints, taste disturbance, and [[ileus|paralytic ileus]] especially with sudden discontinuation of a longer-term high-dose therapy.

Very rarely (&lt;0.01%) adverse reaction includes [[seizures]], [[motor disorder]], ([[akathisia]], [[dyskinesia]]), [[ataxia]], [[polyneuropathy]], [[glaucoma]], [[anxiety]], [[hair loss]], [[agranulocytosis]], severe liver dysfunction after long-term treatment, [[jaundice]], and chronic liver damage.

[[Central nervous system]] [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]]s are quite frequently noted and encompass speech and visual disturbances, mental depression and confusion, hallucinations, headache, insomnia and exacerbation or precipitation of seizures, and increased nervousness. Infrequent cases of respiratory depression or a feeling of suffocation have been observed. Dantrolene often causes sedation severe enough to incapacitate the patient to drive or operate machinery.

Gastrointestinal effects include bad taste, [[anorexia (symptom)|decreased appetite]], nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea.

Liver side effects may be seen either as asymptomatic elevation of [[liver enzyme]]s and/or [[bilirubin]] or, most severe, as fatal and nonfatal [[hepatitis|liver inflammation]]. The risk of liver inflammation is associated with the duration of treatment and the daily dose. In patients treated for hyperthermia, no liver toxicity has been observed so far.

[[Pleural effusion]] with [[pericarditis|inflammation of the fibrous sac around the heart]] (oral treatment only), rare cases of [[Myelosuppression|bone marrow damage]], diffuse [[myalgia|muscle pains]], backache, dermatologic reactions, transient cardiovascular reactions, and [[crystalluria|crystals in the urine]] have additionally been seen.  Muscle weakness may persist for several days following treatment.

    <title>Nalbuphine</title>

Like pure µ-opioids, the mixed agonists-antagonist opioid class of drugs can cause side effects with initial administration of the drug but which lessen over time (“tolerance”).  This is particularly true for the side effects of nausea, sedation and cognitive symptoms (Jovey et al. 2003).  These side effects can in many instances be ameliorated or avoided at the time of drug initiation by titrating the drug from a tolerable starting dose up to the desired therapeutic dose. An important difference between nalbuphine and the pure mu opioid analgesic drugs is the “ceiling effect” on respiration.  Respiratory depression is a potentially fatal side effect from the use of pure mu opioids.  Nalbuphine has limited ability to depress respiratory function (Gal et al. 1982).

As reported in the current Nubain Package Insert (2005), the most frequent side effect in 1066 patients treated with nalbuphine was sedation in 381 (36%).

Other, less frequent reactions are: feeling sweaty/clammy 99 (9%), nausea/vomiting 68 (6%), dizziness/vertigo 58 (5%), dry mouth 44 (4%), and headache 27 (3%). Other adverse reactions which may occur (reported incidence of 1% or less) are:
:* CNS effects: Nervousness, depression, restlessness, crying, euphoria, flushing{{Clarify|date=March 2014}}, hostility, unusual dreams, confusion, faintness, hallucinations, dysphoria, feeling of heaviness, numbness, tingling, unreality. The incidence of psychotomimetic effects, such as unreality, depersonalization, delusions, dysphoria and hallucinations has been shown to be less than that which occurs with pentazocine.
:* Cardiovascular: Hypertension, hypotension, bradycardia, tachycardia, pulmonary edema.
:* Gastrointestinal: Cramps, dyspepsia, bitter taste.
:* Respiration: Depression, dyspnea, asthma.
:* Dermatological: Itching, burning, urticaria.
:* Obstetric: Pseudo-sinusoidal fetal heart rhythm.

Other possible, but rare side effects include speech difficulty, urinary urgency, blurred vision, flushing and warmth.

    <title>Dolasetron</title>

Dolasetron is a well-tolerated drug with few [[adverse drug reaction|side effects]].  Headache, dizziness, and constipation are the most commonly reported side effects associated with its use. There is a potential for prolonging of the QT interval to occur as well. There have been no significant drug interactions reported with this drug's use.  It is broken down by the [[liver]]'s [[cytochrome P450 oxidase|cytochrome P450]] system and it has little effect on the metabolism of other drugs broken down by this system.
Intravenous dolasetron is contraindicated in Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). Doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide are as emetogenic as cisplatin, and preventive drugs should always be considered. The 5HT3 agonists are the mainstays of prevention and are frequently used in combination with other drugs such as corticosteroids and the NK1 receptor antagonist aprepitant. However, the FDA recently issued a drug communication stating that the injection form of dolasetron, a 5HT3 agonist, should no longer be used in adult or pediatric patients with CINV. Dolasetron injection can increase the risk of developing torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal abnormal heart rhythm. Patients with underlying heart conditions or existing heart rate or rhythm problems are at increased risk. Although the oral form of this agent can still be used, careful monitoring and correction of potassium and magnesium levels should be initiated prior to and during treatment. In addition, in older patients and in patients with heart failure, a slow heart rate, underlying cardiac disease, and those with renal impairment, monitoring with electrocardiography is indicated when this drug is used. Congenital long-QT syndrome and drugs that prolong the PR or QRS interval are contraindications to dolasetron therapy. Dolasetron injection may still be used for the prevention and treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting. As per Food and Drug Administration.

    <title>Cisplatin</title>

Cisplatin has a number of side effects that can limit its use:
* [[Nephrotoxicity]] (kidney damage) is a major concern. The dose is reduced when the patient's creatinine clearance (a measure of [[renal function]]) is reduced. Adequate hydration and [[diuretic|diuresis]] is used to prevent renal damage. The nephrotoxicity of platinum-class drugs seems to be related to [[reactive oxygen species]] and in animal models can be ameliorated by [[free radical]] scavenging agents (e.g., [[amifostine]]). Nephrotoxicity is a dose-limiting side effect. It is primarily found on cells of the peripheral nervous system, which are aggregated in large numbers near the ocular and aural stimuli-receiving centers. This noncompetitive interaction has been linked to hydroelectrolytic imbalances and cytoskeleton alterations, both of which have been confirmed in vitro and in vivo. However, NHE-1 inhibition has been found to be both dose-dependent (half-inhibition = 30&amp;nbsp;µg/mL) and reversible.  
* [[Nausea]] and [[vomiting]]: cisplatin is one of the most emetogenic chemotherapy agents, but this symptom is managed with prophylactic antiemetics ([[ondansetron]], [[granisetron]], etc.) in combination with [[corticosteroids]]. [[Aprepitant]] combined with [[ondansetron]] and [[dexamethasone]] has been shown to be better for highly emetogenic chemotherapy than just [[ondansetron]] and [[dexamethasone]].
* [[Ototoxicity]] (hearing loss): there is at present no effective treatment to prevent this side effect, which may be severe.  Audiometric analysis may be necessary to assess the severity of ototoxicity. Other drugs (such as the aminoglycoside antibiotic class) may also cause ototoxicity, and the administration of this class of antibiotics in patients receiving cisplatin is generally avoided.  The ototoxicity of both the aminoglycosides and cisplatin may be related to their ability to bind to [[melanin]] in the [[stria vascularis]] of the inner ear or the generation of [[reactive oxygen species]].
* [[Electrolyte disturbance]]: Cisplatin can cause hypomagnesaemia, hypokalaemia and hypocalcaemia. The hypocalcaemia seems to occur in those with low serum magnesium secondary to cisplatin, so it is not primarily due to the cisplatin.
* [[Hemolytic anemia]] can be developed after several courses of cisplatin. It is suggested that an antibody reacting with a cisplatin-red-cell membrane is responsible for [[hemolysis]].

    <title>Benzalkonium chloride</title>

Although historically benzalkonium chloride has been ubiquitous as a preservative in ophthalmic preparations, its ocular toxicity and irritant properties, in conjunction with consumer demand, have led pharmaceutical companies to increase production of preservative-free preparations, or to replace benzalkonium chloride with preservatives which are less harmful.

Many mass-marketed inhaler and nasal spray formulations contain benzalkonium chloride as a preservative, despite substantial evidence that it can adversely affect ciliary motion, mucociliary transport, nasal mucosal histology, human neutrophil function, and leukocyte response to local inflammation.

Benzalkonium chloride is irritant to middle ear tissues at typically used concentrations. Inner ear toxicity has been demonstrated.

Occupational exposure to benzalkonium chloride has been linked to the development of asthma. In 2011, a large clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of hand sanitizers based on different active ingredients in preventing virus transmission amongst schoolchildren was re-designed to exclude sanitizers based on benzalkonium chloride due to safety concerns.

Benzalkonium chloride has been in common use as a pharmaceutical preservative and antimicrobial since the 1940s. While early studies confirmed the corrosive and irritant properties of benzalkonium chloride, investigations into the adverse effects of, and disease states linked to, benzalkonium chloride have only surfaced during the past 30 years.

Benzalkonium chloride is classed as a Category III antiseptic active ingredient by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]]. Ingredients are categorised as Category III when &quot;available data are insufficient to classify as safe and effective, and further testing is required”. Benzalkonium chloride is excluded from the current United States Food and Drug Administration review of the safety and effectiveness of consumer antiseptics and topical antimicrobial over-the-counter drug products, meaning it will remain a Category III ingredient. There is acknowledgement that more data are required on its safety, efficacy and effectiveness, especially with relation to:

* Human pharmacokinetic studies, including information on its metabolites
* Studies on animal absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion
* Data to help define the effect of formulation on dermal absorption
* Carcinogenicity
* Studies on developmental and reproductive toxicology
* Potential hormonal effects
* Assessment of the potential for development of bacterial resistance

Possible side effects are:
* blurred vision
* eyelid redness
* permanent darkening of eyelashes
* eye discomfort
* permanent darkening of the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] to brown ([[heterochromia]])
* burning sensation during use
* thickening of the eyelashes
* inflammation of the [[Prostate|prostate gland]], restricting urine flow ([[Benign prostatic hyperplasia|BPH]]){{fact|date=July 2016}}

Research suggests that wiping the eye with an absorbent pad after the administration of eye drops can result in shorter eyelashes and a lesser chance of hyperpigmentation in the eyelid, compared to not wiping off excess fluid.

    <title>Rintatolimod</title>

An independent review of rintatolimod trials in chronic fatigue syndrome was published in the December 2006 issue of the Journal of Clinical Virology. It concluded that Ampligen has been &quot;generally well tolerated&quot;, with a &quot;low incidence of clinical toxicity&quot;, particularly when compared with the toxicity of the diseases it is used to treat. &quot;No serious safety issues have resulted from the administration of ~75,000 doses IV (most commonly 400&amp;nbsp;mg) twice weekly for up to one year periods or greater. Animal toxicity studies support this observation in humans, with primates demonstrating the greatest margin of safety.&quot; A mild [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]] reaction has occurred in about 15% of patients, and more rarely reported [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]] include [[chills]], [[fever]], [[malaise]], [[leukopenia]], [[neutropenia]] and [[leukocytosis]]. Some of these side effects may be attributed to a temporary [[Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction|Herxheimer reaction]] in response to pathogen die off. According to Hemispherx and patient testimonials, side-effects, when they occur, usually subside within three to four months or less.

The effects of batroxobin from different species are slightly different. There will be an overview of two different snakes, ''Bothrops atrox'' and ''Bothrops moojeni''. When injected with batroxobin there will be major symptoms affecting the hemostatic system. Batroxobin from ''Bothrops atrox'' mediates the formation of fibrin I. This then renders the blood more prone to coagulation. The blood is thinner and there is an increased tendency to bleed and to leak blood. Hypovolemic shock could occur. This shock can cause organs to stop working and eventually lead to death.

Overdosage symptoms are paradoxical, ranging from [[central nervous system|CNS]] depression to stimulation. Stimulation is most common in children, and is usually followed by excitement, [[hallucinations]], [[ataxia]], loss of coordination, [[muscle twitching]], [[athetosis]], [[hyperthermia]], [[cyanosis]], convulsions, [[tremor]]s, and [[hyperreflexia]]. This may be followed by [[postictal state|postictal]] depression and [[Respiratory arrest|cardiovascular/respiratory arrest]]. Other common overdose symptoms include dry mouth, fixed dilated pupils, flushing of the face, and [[pyrexia]]. In adults, overdose usually leads to CNS depression, ranging from drowsiness to [[coma]].{{mcn|date=May 2015}}

    <title>Cinnarizine</title>

Side effects experienced while taking cinnarizine range from the mild to the quite severe. Possible side effects include drowsiness, sweating, dry mouth, headache, skin problems, lethargy, gastrointestinal irritation, hypersensitivity reactions, as well as movement problems/muscle rigidity, and tremor. Because cinnarizine can cause drowsiness and blurred vision, it is important that users make sure their reactions are normal before driving, operating machinery, or doing any other jobs which could be dangerous if they are not fully alert or able to see well.

Cinnarizine is also known to cause acute and chronic [[parkinsonism]] due to its affinity for D2 receptors, which strongly counter-suggests its actual usefulness for improving neurohealth. Cinnarizine's antagonistic effects of D2 dopamine receptors in the striatum leads to symptoms of depression, tremor, muscle rigidity, tardive dyskinesia, and akathisia, which are characterized as Drug-Induced Parkinson's disease and is the second leading cause of Parkinson's. Evidence suggests that it is one of the metabolites of cinnarizine, C-2, that has an active role in contributing to the development of drug-induced Parkinson's. It is also of note that an estimated 17 of 100 new Parkinson's cases are linked to administration of either cinnarizine or Flunarizine, making cinnarizine and drug-induced Parkinson's a serious issue. Those people especially at risk are elderly patients, in particular women, and patients who have been taking the drug for a longer amount of time.  There is also evidence that suggests that patients with a family history of Parkinson's, or a genetic predispostion to the disease are more likely to develop the drug induced form of this disease as a result of cinnarizine treatment.

In addition to antagonizing D2 receptors, treatment with cinnarizine has also been shown to lead to reduced presynaptic dopamine and serotonin, as well as alterations in vesicular transport of dopamine.  Terland et al. have shown that chronic treatment with cinnarizine builds the drug concentrations high enough that they interfere with the proton electrochemical gradient necessary for packaging dopamine into vesicles. Cinnarizine, pKa = 7.4, acts as a [[protonophore]], which prevents the MgATP-dependent production of the electrochemical gradient crucial to the transport and storage of dopamine into vesicles, and thereby lowers the levels of dopamine in the basal ganglia neurons and leads to the Parkinson's symptoms.

Additionally, several cases of pediatric and adult cinnarizine overdose have been reported, with effects including a range of symptoms such as [[somnolence]], coma, vomiting, [[hypotonia]], stupor, and convulsions.  The cognitive complications likely result from the antihistaminic effects of cinnarizine, while the motor effects are a product of the antidopaminergic properties. In cases of overdose, the patient should be brought to and observed in a hospital for potential neurological complications.

According to information provided by Centocor, maker of one medication based on ustekinumab, their version of the drug is associated with several types of serious adverse effects. These include an increased risk of infection, such as by [[tuberculosis]] and an increased risk of certain types of [[cancer]]. As with some other immunosuppressant drugs like [[ciclosporin]], the brain swelling of [[posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome]] is a risk. The pharmaceutical company also reports serious [[allergic reaction]] as a possible side effect. More common side effects are [[upper respiratory infection]], [[headache]], and [[tiredness]].

Clinical trials have shown that subcutaneous ustekinumab was generally well tolerated. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were of mild severity.

    <title>Vilazodone</title>


On September 6, 2016, the FDA wrote a letter to Forest Labs about Viibryd.  New warnings will be added to the Viibryd label related to a link between the drug and acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis can lead to serious injury and even death. Pancreatitis, especially if it reoccurs, can lead to pancreatic cancer, which is almost always fatal.

Additionally, it is expected that new warnings related to sleep paralysis will also added to the Viibryd label and prescribing information. Sleep paralysis is a condition in which a person is awake but cannot move or speak. Generally, sleep paralysis occurs upon waking and lasts less than one minute. Although sleep paralysis is a serious condition, and can cause psychological harm in the most severe cases, the condition is generally not life threatening.

After a one-year, open-label study assessing the safety and tolerability of vilazodone in people with major depressive disorder, the most common adverse effects were [[diarrhea]] (35.7%), [[nausea]] (31.6%), and [[headache]] (20.0%); greater than 90% of these adverse effects were mild or moderate. Whereas in randomized controlled trials these rates were 28%, 23.4% and 13.3%, respectively. In contrast to other [[SSRI]]s currently on the market, initial clinical trials showed that vilazodone did not cause significant [[Antidepressant#Sexual|decreased sexual desire/function]] as with many other antidepressants, which often cause people to abandon their use.

The principal [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]] of the cephalosporins is hypersensitivity.  Penicillin-sensitive patients will also be allergic to the cephalosporins, depending on the cephalosporin generation.  The previous percentage of 10% cross reactivity rates are often overestimated.  Allergic reactions may present as, for example, rashes, [[pruritus]] (itching), [[urticaria]], [[serum sickness-like reaction]]s with rashes, fever and [[arthralgia]], and [[anaphylaxis]]. The frequency and severity of [[serum sickness]]-like reactions in children has led researchers to question its role in pediatric illness. [[File:Allergy to Antibiotic Cefaclor.JPG|thumb|Skin Allergy to Cefaclor|300px|left]] Other side effects include gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g. diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, abdominal discomfort, disturbances in liver enzymes, transient [[hepatitis]] and cholestatic jaundice), [[headache]], and [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]]. Rare side effects include [[eosinophilia]] and blood disorders (including [[thrombocytopenia]], [[leucopenia]], [[agranulocytosis]], [[aplastic anaemia]] and [[haemolytic anaemia]]); reversible [[interstitial nephritis]]; [[hyperactivity]], [[Anxiety|nervousness]], sleep disturbances, [[hallucinations]], [[confusion]], [[hypertonia]], and [[dizziness]]. [[Toxic epidermal necrolysis]] has been reported. In the UK, The Committee on the Safety of Medicines ([[Committee on Safety of Medicines|CSM]]) has warned that the risk of diarrhea and rarely antibiotic-associated colitis are more likely with higher doses.

    <title>Naloxone</title>

Naloxone has little to no effect if opioids are not present. In people with opioids in their system, it may cause increased sweating, nausea, restlessness, trembling, vomiting, flushing, and headache, and has in rare cases been associated with heart rhythm changes, [[seizures]], and [[pulmonary edema]].

Besides the side effects listed above, naloxone also has other adverse events, such as other cardiovascular effects (hypertension, hypotension, tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia) and central nervous system effects, such as agitation, body pain, brain disease, and coma. In addition to these adverse effects, naloxone is also contraindicated in people with hypersensitivity to naloxone or any of its formulation components.

Naloxone has been shown to block the action of pain-lowering [[endorphin]]s which the body produces naturally. These endorphins likely operate on the same opioid receptors that naloxone blocks. It is capable of blocking a [[placebo]] pain-lowering response, if the placebo is administered together with a hidden or blind injection of naloxone. Other studies have found that placebo alone can activate the body's μ-opioid endorphin system, delivering pain relief by the same receptor mechanism as morphine.

    <title>Hydrocodone</title>

Common [[Adverse drug reaction|side effects]] of hydrocodone are [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[constipation]], [[drowsiness]], [[dizziness]], [[lightheadedness]], [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]], abnormally happy or sad mood, dry throat, difficulty [[urination|urinating]], [[rash]], [[itching]], and narrowing of the pupils.  Serious side effects include slowed or irregular breathing and chest tightness. An epidemiological study indicated that opioid treatment during early pregnancy results in increased risk of various birth defects.

Symptoms of hydrocodone [[drug overdose|overdose]] include narrowed or widened pupils; slow, shallow, or stopped breathing; slowed or stopped heartbeat; cold, clammy, or blue skin; excessive sleepiness; loss of consciousness; seizures; or death.

Hydrocodone can be habit forming, causing physical and psychological dependence. Its abuse liability is similar to morphine and less than oxycodone.

{{See also|List of side effects of aripiprazole}}

In adults side effects with greater than 10% incidence include weight gain, headache, agitation or anxiety, insomnia, and gastro-intestinal effects like nausea and constipation, and lightheadedness. Side effects in children are similar, and include sleepiness, increased appetite, and stuffy nose. A strong desire to gamble, binge eat, shop, and have sex may also occur. Cases of [[pathological gambling]] have been reported.

===Discontinuation===
The [[British National Formulary]] recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing anti-psychotic treatment to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Joanne Moncrieff has suggested that the withdrawal process might itself be schizo-mimetic, producing schizophrenia-like symptoms even in previously healthy patients, indicating a possible pharmacological origin of [[mental illness]] in a yet unknown percentage of patients currently and previously treated with antipsychotics, but the limited evidence was found to support this hypothesis for antipsychotics other than clozapine.

[[Adverse drug reaction]]s associated with fluconazole therapy include:
*Common (≥1% of patients): rash, headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and/or elevated liver enzymes
*Infrequent (0.1–1% of patients): [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], fatigue, constipation
*Rare (&lt;0.1% of patients): [[oliguria]], [[hypokalaemia]], [[paraesthesia]], seizures, [[alopecia]], [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]], [[thrombocytopenia]], other blood [[dyscrasia]]s, serious [[hepatotoxicity]] including [[liver failure]], [[anaphylaxis|anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions]]
*Very rare: prolonged [[QT interval]], ''[[torsades de pointes]]''
* FDA is now saying treatment with chronic, high doses of fluconazole during the first trimester of pregnancy may be associated with a rare and distinct set of birth defects in infants.

If taken during [[pregnancy]] it may result in harm. It is of the [[triazole]] class.

Fluconazole is secreted in human milk at concentrations similar to plasma. Therefore, the use of
fluconazole in lactating mothers is not recommended.

Fluconazole therapy has been associated with [[QT interval]] prolongation, which may lead to serious [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s. Thus, it is used with caution in patients with risk factors for prolonged QT interval, such as electrolyte imbalance or use of other drugs that may prolong the QT interval (particularly [[cisapride]] and [[pimozide]]).{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Fluconazole has also rarely been associated with severe or lethal [[hepatotoxicity]], so [[liver function test]]s are usually performed regularly during prolonged fluconazole therapy. In addition, it is used with caution in patients with pre-existing liver disease.

Some people are allergic to azoles, so those allergic to other azole drugs might be allergic to fluconazole. That is, some azole drugs have adverse side-effects.  Some azole drugs may disrupt estrogen production in pregnancy, affecting pregnancy outcome.


Fluconazole taken at low doses is in FDA pregnancy category C. However, high doses have been associated with a rare and distinct set of birth defects in infants. If taken at these doses, the pregnancy category is changed from category C to category D. Pregnancy category D means there is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on human data. In some cases, the potential benefits from use of the drug in pregnant women with serious or life-threatening conditions may be acceptable despite its risks. Fluconazole should not be taken during pregnancy or if one could become pregnant during treatment without first consulting a doctor. Oral fluconazole is not associated with a significantly increased risk of [[birth defect]]s overall, although it does increase the [[odds ratio]] of [[tetralogy of Fallot]], but the [[absolute risk]] is still low. Women using flucanozol during pregnancy have a 50% higher risk of spontaneous abortion.

===Dermatological===
Severe [[Acne vulgaris|acne]] due to amineptine was first reported in 1988 by various authors&amp;mdash;Grupper, Thioly-Bensoussan, Vexiau, Fiet, Puissant, Gourmel, Teillac, Levigne, to name a few&amp;mdash;simultaneously

===Psychiatric===
Psychomotor excitation can very rarely occur with this drug.

* [[Insomnia]]
* [[Irritability]]
* [[Anxiety|Nervousness]]
* [[Suicidal]] ideation. Seen early in the treatment, by lifting of psychomotor inhibition.

====Abuse and dependence====
The risk of [[Substance dependence|addiction]] is low, but exists nonetheless. Between 1978 and 1988, there were 186 cases of amineptine addiction reported to the French Regional Centres of Pharmacovigilance; an analysis of 155 of those cases found that they were predominantly female, and that two-thirds of cases had known risk factors for addiction. The risk of getting this may or may not be genetically determined.

===Immunological===
In 1989, Sgro and colleagues at the [[Pharmacovigilance|Centre de Pharmacovigilance]] in [[Dijon]] reported a case of [[anaphylactic shock]] in a woman who had been taking amineptine.

There are several adverse reactions from the use of prednisolone:
* Increased appetite, weight gain, nausea and [[malaise]]
* Increased risk of infection 
* [[Cardiovascular disease|Cardiovascular]] events in children
* Dermatological effects including reddening of face, bruising/skin discoloration, impaired wound healing, thinning of skin, skin rash, fluid build up and abnormal hair growth 
* [[Hyperglycemia]]; patients with diabetes may need increased [[insulin]] or diabetic therapies
* Menstrual abnormalities 
* Less response to hormones, especially during stressful instances such as surgery or illness
* Change in electrolytes: rise in [[blood pressure]], increased sodium and low potassium, leading to [[alkalosis]] 
* GI system effects: swelling of stomach lining, reversible increase in liver enzymes and risk of [[Peptic ulcer|stomach ulcers]]
* Muscular and skeletal abnormalities, such as muscle weakness/muscle loss, [[osteoporosis]], long bone fractures, tendon rupture and back fractures
* Neurological effects, including involuntary movements ([[convulsion]]s), headaches and [[vertigo]]   
* Behavioral disturbances    
Nasal septum perforation and bowel perforation are also notable adverse effects that restrict steroid use in some pathologic conditions.

Withdrawal from prednisolone after long-term or high-dose use can lead to [[adrenal insufficiency]].

===Pregnancy and breastfeeding ===
Although there are no major human studies of prednisolone use in pregnant women, studies in several animals show that it may cause birth defects including increase [[Cleft lip and palate|cleft palate]]. Prednisolone should be used in pregnant women when benefits outweigh the risks and children born from mothers using prednisolone during pregnancy should be monitored for impaired adrenal function.

Prednisolone is found in breast milk of mothers taking prednisolone.

    <title>Dicloxacillin</title>

Common [[adverse drug reaction]]s (ADRs) associated with the use of dicloxacillin include: [[diarrhoea]], [[nausea]], [[rash]], [[urticaria]], [[pain]] and [[inflammation]] at injection site, [[superinfection]] (including [[candidiasis]]), [[allergy]], and transient increases in liver enzymes and bilirubin.

On rare occasions, [[cholestasis|cholestatic jaundice]] (also referred to as cholestatic hepatitis) has been associated with dicloxacillin therapy. The reaction may occur up to several weeks after treatment has stopped, and takes weeks to resolve. The estimated incidence is 1 in 15,000 exposures, and is more frequent in people over 55 years old, females, and those with treatment longer than 2 weeks.

It should be used with caution and monitored in the elderly, particularly with intravenous administration, due to a risk of [[thrombophlebitis]].

=== Interactions ===

* Warfarin
* Methotrexate
* Tetracyclines

    <title>Nevirapine</title>


The most common adverse effect of nevirapine is the development of mild or moderate rash (13%).

Nevirapine may cause severe or life-threatening liver toxicity, usually emerging in the first six weeks of treatment. has led the U.S. DHHS to recommend the restriction of nevirapine use to those at lower risk, unless the benefit to the patient clearly outweighs the risk; although in the 2NN study which found these CD4 limits, the effect was seen only in patients recruited from Thailand. More recent studies on the use of Nevirapine in people with higher CD4 cell counts have come to the following conclusion: Treatment-experienced patients who start NVP-based combination therapy with low pre–ART and high current CD4 cell counts and an undetectable VL have a similar likelihood for discontinuing NVP therapy because of hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs), compared with treatment-naive patients with low CD4 cell counts. This suggests that NVP-based combination therapy may be safely initiated in such patients. However, in similar patients with a detectable VL, it is prudent to continue to adhere to current CD4 cell count thresholds. The U.S. Public Health Service Task Force advocates caution in the use of nevirapine in pregnancy due to toxicity issues, which may be exacerbated during pregnancy.

U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends stopping nevirapine if a person experiencing:
* sign and symptoms of liver issues such as [[hepatitis]]
* increased [[Elevated transaminases|transaminases]] in addition to rash or systemic symptoms
* formation of rash with systemic symptoms
* severe skin or hypersensitivity reactions
Additionally, U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] recommends monitoring closely for first 6 weeks of therapy for above symptoms as there is high risk during this time. Monitor for up to the first 18 weeks of treatment and if a patient experiences 1) hepatitis plus rash or other systemic symptoms or 2) severe hypersensitivity or skin rash, nervirapine should not be restarted.

{{Main|Side effects of bicalutamide}}

The [[side effect]] profile of bicalutamide is highly dependent on sex; that is, on whether the person is male or female. In men, due to [[hypoandrogenism|androgen deprivation]], a variety of side effects of varying severity may occur during bicalutamide treatment, with [[mastodynia|breast pain/tenderness]] and [[gynecomastia]] ([[breast development]]/[[mammoplasia|enlargement]]) being the most common. In women, due to the minimal biological importance of androgens in this sex, General side effects of bicalutamide that may occur in either sex include [[diarrhea]], [[constipation]], [[abdominal pain]], [[nausea]], [[dry skin]], [[pruritus|itching]], and [[rash]].

Bicalutamide monotherapy has been associated with abnormal [[liver function tests]] such as [[elevated liver enzymes]] in 3.4% of men relative to 1.9% for standard care. Monitoring of liver function during treatment is recommended, particularly in the first few months. In men of advanced age with prostate cancer, bicalutamide monotherapy has been associated with an increase in non-prostate cancer [[mortality rate|mortality]], in part due to an increase in the rate of heart failure. These mortality-related effects are thought to be a consequence of androgen deprivation, rather than a specific drug-related toxicity of bicalutamide. Bicalutamide has also been associated with several case reports of [[interstitial pneumonitis]], which can potentially progress to [[pulmonary fibrosis]]. [[Hypersensitivity reaction]]s ([[drug allergy]]) like [[angioedema]] and [[urticaria|hives]] have also uncommonly been reported in association with bicalutamide. Because it is an antiandrogen, bicalutamide has a theoretical risk of [[birth defect]]s like [[ambiguous genitalia]] and brain feminization in male [[fetus]]es. Conversely, bicalutamide monotherapy is associated with much higher rates of breast tenderness, gynecomastia, and feminization in men than {{abbr|GnRH|gonadotropin-releasing hormone}} analogues and {{abbr|CPA|cyproterone acetate}}. However, gynecomastia with bicalutamide is rarely severe and discontinuation rates due to this side effect are fairly low. These differences in side effects between bicalutamide monotherapy, {{abbr|GnRH|gonadotropin-releasing hormone}} analogues, and {{abbr|CPA|cyproterone acetate}} are attributed to the fact that whereas {{abbr|GnRH|gonadotropin-releasing hormone}} analogues and {{abbr|CPA|cyproterone acetate}} suppress estrogen production, bicalutamide monotherapy does not lower estrogen levels and in fact actually increases them.

Bicalutamide does not share the high risk of [[neuropsychiatry|neuropsychiatric]] side effects like depression, [[anxiety]], and [[suicidality]] as well as [[cardiovascular]] side effects like [[coagulation]] changes, [[thrombosis]], [[water retention (medicine)|fluid retention]], [[ischemic cardiomyopathy]], and adverse [[serum lipids|serum lipid]] changes that {{abbr|CPA|cyproterone acetate}} is associated with. Unlike [[enzalutamide]], bicalutamide is not associated with [[seizure]]s or related [[central nervous system|central]] side effects like anxiety and [[insomnia]]. In women, unlike {{abbr|CPA|cyproterone acetate}} and spironolactone, bicalutamide does not produce [[menstrual irregularity]] or [[amenorrhea]] and does not interfere with [[ovulation]] or [[fertility]].

Nephrotoxicity
*Can increase serum [[creatinine]] levels; renal function should be monitored periodically in patients with renal insufficiency
Biliary
*Can increase cholesterol excretion into the bile, leading to risk of [[cholelithiasis]]; if suspected, gallbladder studies are indicated. See &quot;Interaction&quot; section under [[Bile acid sequestrant]]
Coagulation/Bleeding
*Exercise caution in concomitant treatment with oral coumarin anticoagulants (e.g. [[warfarin]]). Adjust the dosage of coumarin to maintain the prothrombin time/INR at desired level to prevent bleeding complications.

The development of [[anti-nuclear antibodies]] (ANA) has been found in 10 to 30% of patients under treatment with acebutolol. A systemic disease with arthralgic pain and myalgias has been observed in 1%. A [[lupus erythematosus]]-like syndrome with skin rash and multiforme organ involvement is even less frequent. The incidence of both ANA and symptomatic disease under acebutolol is higher than under [[Propranolol]]. Female patients are more likely to develop these symptoms than male patients. Some few cases of hepatotoxicity with increased [[liver enzymes]] ([[Alanine transaminase|ALT]], [[Alanine transaminase|AST]]) have been seen. Altogether, 5 to 6% of all patients treated have to discontinue acebutolol due to intolerable side effects. When possible, the treatment should be discontinued gradually in order to avoid a withdrawal syndrome with increased frequency of angina and even precipitation of [[myocardial infarction]].

    <title>Halothane</title>

In rare cases, repeated exposure to halothane in adults was noted to result in severe [[liver]] injury. This occurred in about one in 10,000 exposures. The resulting syndrome was referred to as halothane [[hepatitis]], and is thought to result from the metabolism of halothane to [[trifluoroacetic acid]] via oxidative reactions in the liver. About 20% of inhaled halothane is metabolized by the liver and these products are excreted in the urine. The hepatitis syndrome had a mortality rate of 30% to 70%. Concern for hepatitis resulted in a dramatic reduction in the use of halothane for adults and it was replaced in the 1980s by [[enflurane]] and [[isoflurane]]. By 2005, the most common volatile anesthetics used were [[isoflurane]], [[sevoflurane]], and [[desflurane]]. Since the risk of halothane hepatitis in children was substantially lower than in adults, halothane continued to be used in pediatrics in the 1990s as it was especially useful for inhalation induction of anaesthesia  . However, by 2000, sevoflurane, excellent for inhalation induction, had largely replaced the use of halothane in children.

Halothane sensitises the heart to catecholamines, so it is liable to cause cardiac arrhythmias, occasionally fatal, particularly if [[hypercapnia]] has been allowed to develop.  This seems to be especially problematic in dental anaesthesia.

Like all the potent inhalational anaesthetic agents, it is a potent trigger for [[malignant hyperthermia]].  Similarly, in common with the other potent inhalational agents, it relaxes uterine smooth muscle and this may increase blood loss during delivery or termination of pregnancy.

=== Occupational safety ===
People can be exposed to halothane in the workplace by breathing it in as waste anaesthetic gas, skin contact, eye contact, or swallowing it. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL) of 2 ppm (16.2&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) over 60 minutes.

One of the undesirable effects of small-molecule drugs is that they can lack specificity for their target; hence bind to similar targets in other unrelated proteins, which can result in undesirable drug-related side effects. However, pre-clinical studies have shown volasertib binds in a highly selective manner to the kinase domain of the PLK family, without binding to other proteins with a kinase domain. Clinical studies have shown that at the maximum tolerated dose, side effects of volasertib include; [[anaemia]] (22%), [[thrombocytopenia]], [[neutropenia]] and [[febrile neutropenia]]. Common side effects as seen with other antimitotic agents such as [[vinca alkaloid]]s and [[taxane]]s which include neuropathy, have not been observed with volasertib.

The main side effects of glybuzole and other sulphonylureas are induction of [[hypoglycaemia]], weight gain, abdominal upset, [[headache]], and [[hypersensitivity]] reactions. Hypoglycaemia is mainly caused by excesses in insulin production due to doses that are too high, or due to the eating habits of the patient.

===Contraindications===

It should not be taken if the patient has a hypersensitivity for sulphonylureas.

===Interactions===

There are some drugs that prolong the effects of drugs such as glybuzole and thereby increase the possibility of hypoglycaemia, these drugs include allopurinol, sulfonamides, acetylsalicylic acid and derivatives and fibrates.

The US label carries a [[black box warning]] of the risk of drug causing [[liver toxicity]], in particular [[hepatic veno-occlusive disease]] (VOD), which has been fatal in some people.   The risk of this is higher in people who take the drug before having [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]] (HSCT) and more people die who have HSCT following treatment with this drug, than people who have HSCT taking other chemotherapies.

    <title>Chloroxylenol</title>

Chloroxylenol is not significantly [[toxic]] to [[human]]s, is practically non-toxic to birds, and is moderately toxic to freshwater invertebrates.  It is highly toxic to [[fish]] and [[cats]] and should not be used around them. It is a mild [[skin]] [[irritation|irritant]] and may trigger [[allergic]] reactions in some individuals.

===Humans===
Chloroxylenol has the potential for causing lethal [[toxicity]]. It is [[poisonous]] when [[ingested|swallowed]] and even when it is unintentionally [[inhaled|breathed in]].

In a case report, a 42-year-old British man died from Dettol overexposure in May 2007.  He had &quot;obsessive cleaning disorder&quot; and used to keep buckets of Dettol around his flat with rooms littered with Dettol. The [[autopsy]] was not able to conclude whether the lethal exposure to Dettol was via ingestion or inhalation. A medical study which analyzed 177 cases of Dettol intoxications via ingestion in [[Hong Kong]] concluded that ″Dettol poisoning resulted in serious complications in 7% of patients, including death&quot;.

===Animals===
Chloroxylenol is toxic to many animals, especially cats.  Phenols are of particular concern because cats are unable to eliminate the toxins following ingestion. A cat may swallow the product by licking its paws after they have come into contact with it.

In [[Australia]], chloroxylenol spray has been shown to be lethal to [[cane toad]]s, an [[invasive species]] that was introduced from [[Hawaii]] as a result of bad judgment in 1935. It had been hoped that the amphibian would control the [[cane beetle]] but it became highly destructive within the ecosystem. Spraying the disinfectant at close range has been shown to cause rapid death to toads. It is not known whether the toxins are persistent or whether they harm other Australian flora and fauna.

Owing to concerns over potential harm to other Australian wildlife species, the use of chloroxylenol as an agent for [[pest control]] was banned in Western Australia by the [[Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia)|Department of Environment and Conservation]] in 2011.

Gastrointestinal side effects are more common in those receiving fluvoxamine than with other SSRIs.

    <title>Meloxicam</title>

Meloxicam use can result in [[human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] toxicity and bleeding, headaches, rash, and [[melena|very dark or black stool]] (a sign of intestinal bleeding). Like other [[NSAID]]s, its use is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events such as [[heart attack]] and [[stroke]]. It has fewer gastrointestinal side effects than [[diclofenac]], [[piroxicam]], [[naproxen]], and perhaps all other NSAIDs which are not COX-2 selective. Although meloxicam inhibits formation of [[thromboxane]] A, it does not appear to do so at levels that would interfere with [[platelet]] function.

A pooled analysis of randomized, controlled studies of meloxicam therapy of up to 60 days duration found that meloxicam was associated with a statistically significantly lower number of [[thrombosis|thromboembolic]] complications than the NSAID diclofenac (0.2% versus 0.8% respectively) but a similar incidence of thromboembolic events to naproxen and piroxicam.

===Cardiovascular side effects===
Persons with hypertension, high cholesterol, or diabetes are at risk for cardiovascular side effects. Persons with family history of heart disease, heart attack, or stroke must tell their treating physician as the potential for serious cardiovascular side effects is significant.

Studies examining a current significant health concern, anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity (including with sevoflurane, and especially with children and infants) are &quot;fraught with confounders, and many are underpowered statistically&quot;, and so are argued to need &quot;further data... to either support or refute the potential connection&quot;.

Concern regarding the safety of anaesthesia is especially acute with regard to children and infants, where preclinical evidence from relevant animal models suggest that common clinically important agents, including sevoflurane, may be neurotoxic to the developing brain, and so cause neurobehavioural abnormalities in the long term; two large-scale clinical studies (PANDA and GAS) were ongoing as of 2010, in hope of supplying &quot;significant [further] information&quot; on neurodevelopmental effects of general anaesthesia in infants and young children, including where sevoflurane is used.

Healthy adults taking regular doses of up to 4,000&amp;nbsp;mg a day show little evidence of toxicity (although some researchers disagree). They are more likely to have abnormal liver function tests, but the significance of this is uncertain.

===Liver damage===
Acute [[overdose]]s of paracetamol can cause potentially fatal [[Hepatotoxicity|liver damage]]. In 2011 the [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] launched a public education program to help consumers avoid overdose, warning: &quot;Acetaminophen can cause serious liver damage if more than directed is used.&quot; In a 2011 Safety Warning the FDA immediately required manufacturers to update labels of all prescription combination acetaminophen products to warn of the potential risk for severe liver injury and required that such combinations contain no more than 325&amp;nbsp;mg of acetaminophen. Overdoses are frequently related to high-dose [[Recreational drug use|recreational use]] of prescription [[opioids]], as these opioids are most often combined with acetaminophen. The overdose risk may be heightened by frequent consumption of alcohol.

[[Paracetamol toxicity]] is the foremost cause of [[acute liver failure]] in the [[Western world]] and accounts for most drug overdoses in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. Paracetamol overdose results in more calls to [[poison control center]]s in the US than overdose of any other pharmacological substance. [[Activated charcoal]] can be used to decrease absorption of paracetamol if the person comes to the hospital soon after the overdose. While the antidote, [[acetylcysteine]] (also called N-acetylcysteine or NAC), acts as a precursor for glutathione, helping the body regenerate enough to prevent or at least decrease the possible damage to the liver, a [[liver transplant]] is often required if damage to the liver becomes severe. [[Kidney failure]] is also a possible side effect.

Until 2004, tablets were available (brand-name in the UK Paradote) that combined paracetamol with an antidote ([[methionine]]) to protect the liver in case of an overdose. One theoretical, but rarely if ever used, option in the United States is to request a [[compounding pharmacy]] to make a similar drug mix for people who are at risk.

In June 2009, a [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) advisory committee recommended that new restrictions be placed on paracetamol usage in the United States to help protect people from the potential toxic effects. The maximum dosage at any given time would be decreased from 1000&amp;nbsp;mg to 650&amp;nbsp;mg, while combinations of paracetamol and [[opioid]] [[analgesic]]s would be prohibited. Committee members were particularly concerned by the fact that the then present maximum dosages of paracetamol had been shown to produce alterations in [[liver|hepatic]] function.
In November 2011, the [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]] revised UK dosing of liquid paracetamol for children.

===Pregnancy===
Experimental studies in animals and cohort studies in humans indicate no detectable increase in congenital malformations associated with paracetamol use during [[pregnancy]]. Additionally, paracetamol does not affect the closure of the fetal [[ductus arteriosus]] as NSAIDs can.

Paracetamol use by the mother during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of childhood [[asthma]]. It is also associated with an increase in [[ADHD]] but it is unclear whether the relationship is causal. A 2015 review states that paracetamol remains a first-line recommended medication for pain and fever during pregnancy, despite these concerns.

===Cancer===
Some studies have found an association between paracetamol and a slight increase in [[renal cell carcinoma|kidney cancer]], but no effect on [[bladder cancer]] risk.

Rarely [[allergy|allergical]] reactions may occur (from dermal or mucosal symptoms to [[anaphylaxis|anaphylactic shock]]). At overdosing a toxical reaction arises - excitation, [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]], [[dishevelment]], visual defects, buzzing in ears, [[muscle]] thrill to [[tremor]], in more severe cases [[somnolence]], [[hyporeflexia]], breathing defects to [[apnea]], [[convulsions]].
    <title>Baclofen</title>

===Withdrawal syndrome===
Discontinuation of baclofen can be associated with a withdrawal syndrome which resembles [[benzodiazepine withdrawal]] and [[alcohol withdrawal]]. [[Withdrawal symptoms]] are more likely if baclofen is used for long periods of time (more than a couple of months) and can occur from low or high doses. The severity of baclofen withdrawal depends on the rate at which it is discontinued. Thus to minimise withdrawal symptoms, the dose should be tapered down slowly when discontinuing baclofen therapy. Abrupt withdrawal is more likely to result in severe withdrawal symptoms. Acute withdrawal symptoms can be stopped by recommencing baclofen.

=== Abuse potential ===
[[File:Baclosan.JPG|right|thumb|Russian baclofen (branded Baclosan) 25 mg tablets with a warning: &quot;This drug may suppress psychomotor skills&quot;]]
Baclofen, at standard dosing, does not produce [[euphoria]] or other [[Brain stimulation reward|pleasant]] effects, does not possess [[drug addiction|addictive]] properties, and has not been associated with any degree of [[craving (withdrawal)|drug craving]]. In contrast to baclofen, another GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor agonist, [[γ-hydroxybutyric acid]] (GHB), has been associated with euphoria, abuse, and addiction. Although baclofen does not produce euphoria or other reinforcing effects, which is unlike [[drinking alcohol|alcohol]] and [[benzodiazepine]]s (as well as GHB), it does similarly possess [[sedative]] and [[anxiolytic|antianxiety]] properties.

===Overdose===
Reports of [[overdose]] indicate that baclofen may cause symptoms including [[vomiting]], [[asthenia|weakness]], [[sedation]], [[somnolence]], [[hypoventilation|respiratory depression]], [[seizure]]s, unusual pupil size, dizziness, [[itching]], [[hypothermia]], [[bradycardia]], [[hypertension]], [[hyporeflexia]], [[coma]], and [[death]].

Possible [[side effects]] include:
* [[Anterograde amnesia]] and [[Attention|concentration]] problems
* [[Ataxia]], [[slurred speech]]
* [[Disinhibition]]
* [[Jaundice]] (very rare)
* [[Skin rash]], [[respiratory depression]], [[constipation]]
* [[Suicidal ideation]] or [[suicide]]
* [[Urinary retention]] (infrequent)
* [[Fasciculations|Twitches]] and [[tremor]]

===Food and drug interactions===
Alprazolam is primarily [[metabolised|metabolized]] via [[CYP3A4]]. Combination of alprazolam with the herb [[kava]] can result in the development of a semi-[[coma]]tose state.  Plants in the ''[[Hypericum]]'' genus (including [[St. John's wort]]) conversely can lower the plasma levels of alprazolam and reduce its therapeutic effect.

===Overdose===
[[File:Xanax 0.25, 0.5 &amp; 1 mg.jpg|thumb|Xanax: 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg scored tablets]]
{{main article|Benzodiazepine overdose}}

Overdoses of alprazolam can be mild to severe depending on how much of it taken and other drugs that have been taken.

Alprazolam overdoses cause excess [[central nervous system]] (CNS) depression and may include one or more of the following symptoms:
* Coma and death if alprazolam is combined with other substances.
* [[Fainting]]
* [[Hypotension]] (low blood pressure)
* [[Hypoventilation]] (shallow breathing)
* Impaired [[motor functions]]
** [[Dizziness]]
** [[Balance disorder|Impaired balance]]
** Impaired or absent [[reflexes]]
** [[Muscle weakness]]
* [[Orthostatic hypotension]] (fainting while standing up too quickly)
* [[Somnolence]] (drowsiness)

===Dependence and withdrawal===
{{See also|Benzodiazepine dependence|Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome}}

Alprazolam, like other benzodiazepines, binds to specific sites on the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; ([[gamma-amino-butyric acid]]) receptor. When bound to these sites, which are referred to as benzodiazepine receptors, it modulates the effect of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors and, thus, of GABAergic neurons. Long-term use causes adaptive changes in the benzodiazepine receptors, making them less sensitive to stimulation and thus making the drugs less potent.

Not all withdrawal effects are evidence of true dependence or withdrawal. Recurrence of symptoms such as anxiety may simply indicate that the drug was having its expected anti-anxiety effect and that, in the absence of the drug, the symptom has returned to pretreatment levels. If the symptoms are more severe or frequent, the person may be experiencing a [[rebound effect]] due to the removal of the drug. Either of these can occur without the person actually being drug-dependent.

Alprazolam and other benzodiazepines may also cause the development of [[physical dependence]], [[drug tolerance|tolerance]], and [[benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms]] during rapid dose reduction or cessation of therapy after long-term treatment. There is a higher chance of withdrawal reactions if the drug is administered in a higher dosage than recommended, or if a person stops taking the medication altogether without slowly allowing the body to adjust to a lower-dosage regimen.

High thymidine phosphorylase expression is also found in the human intestinal tract, resulting in dose-limiting toxicity (diarrhea) in some individuals.  

The most frequent adverse effects for doxifluridine were neurotoxicity and mucositis.

    <title>Sodium stibogluconate</title>

Sodium stibogluconate is exceedingly toxic to [[veins]].  One of the practical problems is that after a few doses it can become exceedingly difficult to find a vein in which to inject the drug.  The insertion of a [[peripherally inserted central catheter|PICC]] does not prevent the problem and can instead exacerbate it: the entire vein along the course of the PICC line can become inflamed and [[thrombosis|thrombose]].  Large doses of sodium stibogluconate are often administered as dilute solutions.

[[Pancreatitis]] is a common deleterious effect of the drug, and the [[blood plasma|serum]] [[amylase]] or [[lipase]] should be monitored twice weekly; there is no need to stop treatment if the amylase remains less than four times the upper limit of normal; if the amylase rises above the cut-off, then treatment should be interrupted until the amylase falls to less than twice the upper limit of normal, whereupon treatment can be resumed.  Cardiac conduction disturbances are less common, but [[electrocardiograph|ECG]] monitoring while the medicine is injected is advisable and changes quickly reverse after the drug is stopped or the infusion rate is decreased.

The drug can be given intramuscularly but is exceedingly painful when given by this route.  It can also be given intralesionally when treating [[cutaneous leishmaniasis]] (i.e., injected directly into the area of infected skin) and again, this is exceedingly painful and does not give results superior to intravenous administration.

Sodium stibogluconate can also cause a reduced appetite, metallic taste in mouth, [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[diarrhoea]], headache, tiredness, joint pains, muscle aches, dizziness, and [[anaphylaxis]].

    <title>Acetylcysteine</title>

The most commonly reported adverse effects for IV formulations of acetylcysteine are rash, [[urticaria]], and [[pruritus|itchiness]]. Up to 18% of patients have been reported to experience [[anaphylaxis]] reaction, which are defined as rash, 
[[hypotension]], wheezing, and/or shortness of breath.  Lower rates of anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with slower rates of infusion.

Adverse effects for inhalational formulations of acetylcysteine include nausea, vomiting, [[stomatitis]], fever, [[rhinorrhea]], drowsiness, clamminess, chest tightness, and bronchoconstriction. Although infrequent, bronchospasm has been reported to occur unpredictably in some patients.

Antioxidants are widely used to protect cells from damage induced by [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS). The concept that antioxidants can help fight cancer is deeply rooted in the general population, promoted by the food supplement industry. However, clinical trials have reported inconsistent results. Nonetheless, positive effects on age-diminished control of respiration  (the [[control of respiration|hypoxic ventilatory response]]) have been observed previously in human subjects at more moderate doses.

Although N-acetylcysteine prevented liver damage when taken before alcohol, when taken four hours after alcohol it made liver damage worse in a dose-dependent fashion.

    <title>Brotizolam</title>

Common side effects of brotizolam are typical of hypnotic benzodiazepines and are related to [[Central nervous system|CNS depression]], and include [[somnolence]], [[ataxia]], [[headache]], [[anterograde amnesia]], [[dizziness]], [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], impairment of motor functions, slurred speech, [[confusion]], and [[Accident-proneness|clumsiness]].

Less common side effects include [[hypotension]], [[respiratory depression]], hallucinations, nausea and vomiting, [[palpitation]]s, and paradoxical reactions (i.e. aggression, anxiety, violent behavior, etc.).

Brotizolam can cause residual side effects the next day such as impaired cognitive and motor functions as well as drowsiness. Disruption of sleep patterns may also occur such as suppression of [[REM sleep]]. These side effects are more likely at higher doses (above 0.5–1&amp;nbsp;mg).

In clinical trials brotizolam 0.125 to 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg improved sleep in insomniacs similarly to [[nitrazepam]] 2.5 and 5&amp;nbsp;mg, [[flunitrazepam]] 2&amp;nbsp;mg and [[triazolam]] 0.25&amp;nbsp;mg, whilst brotizolam 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg was shown to be superior to [[flurazepam]] 30&amp;nbsp;mg, but inferior to [[temazepam]] 30&amp;nbsp;mg in some studies. Brotizolam at dosages below 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg at night usually produced minimal morning drowsiness; no residual impairment of psychomotor performance occurs following dosages within the recommended range of 0.125 to 0.25&amp;nbsp;mg. No serious side effects have been reported to date and the most frequently observed adverse experiences are drowsiness, headache and dizziness. Mild rebound insomnia may occur in some patients when treatment is stopped.

Nilotinib has a number of adverse effects typical of anti-cancer drugs. These include headache, fatigue, gastrointestinal problems such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and constipation, muscle and joint pain, [[rash]] and other skin conditions, flu-like symptoms, and reduced blood cell count. Less typical side effects are those of the cardiovascular system, such as hypertension (high blood pressure), various types of [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]], and prolonged [[QT interval]]. Nilotinib can also affect the body's [[electrolyte]] and [[glucose]] balance. Though pulmonary-related adverse effects are rare when compared with [[imatinib]] and [[dasatinib]], there is a case report of acute respiratory failure from [[diffuse alveolar hemorrhage]] in a patient taking nilotinib.

Symptoms of an overdose on armodafinil include trouble sleeping, restlessness, confusion, disorientation, feeling excited, mania, hallucinations, nausea, diarrhea, severely increased or decreased heart beat, chest pain, and increased blood pressure.


Serious rashes can develop in rare cases, and require immediate medical attention due to the possibility of [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome|Steven's-Johnson Syndrome]], or other [[Hypersensitivity|hypersensitivites]] to armodafinil.

There are no absolute contraindications to the use of dexmedetomidine. Dexmedetomidine has a biphasic effect on blood pressure with decreased blood pressure observed at lower concentrations and elevated blood pressure at higher concentrations. Rapid IV administration or bolus has been associated with slow heart rate ([[bradycardia]]) and low blood pressure ([[hypotension]]) due to peripheral α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-receptor stimulation.

    <title>Tigecycline</title>

As a tetracycline derivative, tigecycline exhibits similar [[Tetracycline|side effects]] to the class of antibiotics. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are the most common reported side effect.

Common side effects of tigecycline include nausea and vomiting. Nausea (26%) and vomiting (18%) tend to be mild or moderate and usually occur during the first two days of therapy.

Rare adverse effects (&lt;2%) include: swelling, pain, and irritation at injection site, anorexia, jaundice, hepatic dysfunction, pruritus, acute pancreatitis, and increased prothrombin time.

=== Precautions ===
Precaution is needed when taken in individuals with tetracycline hypersensitivity, pregnant women, and children. It has been found to cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy and therefore is classified as [[pregnancy category D]]. In rats or rabbits, tigecycline crossed the placenta and was found in the fetal tissues, and is associated with slightly lower birth weights as well as slower bone ossification. Even though it was not considered teratogenic, tigecycline should be avoided unless benefits outweigh the risks. In addition, its use during childhood can cause yellow-grey-brown discoloration of the teeth and should not be used unless necessary.

More so, there are clinical reports of tigecycline-induced [[acute pancreatitis]], with particular relevance to patients also diagnosed with [[cystic fibrosis]]. Increased mortality was in comparison to other treatment of the same types of infections. The difference was not statistically significant for any type, but mortality was numerically greater for every infection type with Tigecycline treatment, and prompted a black box warning by the FDA.

===Black box warning===
FDA issued a black box warning in September 2010 for tigecycline regarding an increased risk of death compared to other appropriate treatment.

In 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) updated the warnings section of the drug label to include information regarding increased mortality risk (seen most clearly in people treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia, especially ventilator-associated pneumonia).

=== Drug interactions ===
Tigecycline has been found to interact with medications, such as:
* [[Warfarin]]: Since both tigecycline and warfarin bind to serum or plasma proteins, there is potential for protein-binding interactions, such that one drug will have more effect than the other. Although dose adjustment is not necessary, INR and prothrombin time should be monitored if given concurrently.
* [[Oral contraceptive pill|Oral contraceptives]]: Effectiveness of oral contraceptives are decreased with concurrent use due to reduction in the concentration levels of oral contraceptives.  
However, the mechanism behind these drug interactions have not been fully analyzed.

    <title>Ritonavir</title>

When administered at doses effective for anti-HIV therapy, the side effects of ritonavir are those shown below.  It is currently (2015) much more widely used at lower doses as a pharmacokinetic inhibitor.  The adverse effects of these lower doses of ritonavir do not appear to have been extensively characterized.

* diarrhea
* nausea and vomiting
* abdominal pain
* dizziness
* insomnia
* sweating
* taste abnormality
* metabolic
** [[hypercholesterolemia]]
** [[hypertriglyceridemia]]
** elevated [[transaminase]]s
** elevated [[Creatine kinase|CPK]]

One of ritonavir's side effects is [[hyperglycemia]]. It appears that ritonavir directly inhibits the [[GLUT4]] insulin-regulated transporter, keeping glucose from entering fat and muscle cells.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}  This can lead to [[insulin resistance]] and cause problems for people with [[type Ⅱ diabetes]]. The capsules of the medication do not have the same bioavailability as the tablets.

    <title>Methotrexate</title>

The most common adverse effects include: [[hepatotoxicity]] (liver damage), [[ulcerative stomatitis]], [[leukopenia]] and thus predisposition to infection, nausea, abdominal pain, fatigue, fever, dizziness, acute [[pneumonitis]], rarely [[pulmonary fibrosis]], and [[kidney failure]]. Methotrexate is [[Teratology|teratogenic]] and hence is not advised for either the prospective father to take it before or for the mother to take it before or during pregnancy ([[Pregnancy category|pregnancy category X]]) and for a period after birth.

Central nervous system reactions to methotrexate have been reported, especially when given via the [[Intrathecal administration|intrathecal route]] (directly into the [[cerebrospinal fluid]]), which include [[Myelopathy|myelopathies]] and [[Leukoencephalopathy|leucoencephalopathies]]. It has a variety of cutaneous side effects, particularly when administered in high doses.

Another little understood but serious possible adverse effect of methotrexate is neurological damage and memory loss. Neurotoxicity may result from the drug crossing the [[blood–brain barrier]] and damaging neurons in the cerebral cortex. People with cancer who receive the medication often nickname these effects &quot;[[chemo brain]]&quot; or &quot;chemo fog&quot;. While they may be used together, increased monitoring is recommended. The [[aminoglycoside]]s, [[neomycin]] and [[paromomycin]], have been found to reduce gastrointestinal (GI) absorption of methotrexate. Likewise, [[retinoid]]s and [[trimethoprim]] have been known to interact with methotrexate to produce additive hepatotoxicity and haematotoxicity, respectively. Other immunosuppressants like [[ciclosporin]] may potentiate methotrexate's haematologic effects, hence potentially leading to toxicity. [[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAIDs]] have also been found to fatally interact with methotrexate in numerous case reports. [[Nitrous oxide]] potentiating the haematological toxicity of methotrexate has also been documented. [[Proton-pump inhibitors]] such as [[omeprazole]] and the [[anticonvulsant]] [[valproate]] have been found to increase the plasma concentrations of methotrexate, as have nephrotoxic agents such as [[cisplatin]], the GI drug [[colestyramine]], and [[dantrolene]].

    <title>Tiapride</title>

Although it is considered a &quot;safe&quot; medicine, it is, like sulpiride, strictly contraindicated for patients under the age of 18 due to its effects during the process of puberty. This is likely related to its side effects on levels of the hormone prolactin, which is involved in sexual development. There are also insufficient clinical data on the other side effects in adolescents.

Tiapride has been found to cause [[Hyperprolactinaemia|excess prolactin]] levels in plasma, which can cause decreased [[libido]], [[infertility]] and increased risk of [[breast cancer]].

Dosages above approximately 300&amp;nbsp;mg/day risk inducing tardive dyskinesia. However, given the drug's fairly wide window of tolerable doses, dosages can often be titrated to obtain the desired effect without bringing about motor deficits. In general, tiapride is considered an [[atypical antipsychotic]] because of its low risk for [[extrapyramidal symptoms]], such as [[akinesia]] and [[akathesia]]. These effects are thought to be reduced in tiapride relative to [[typical antipsychotics]] because of its selectivity for the limbic system over extrapyramidal areas that control movement.

Injectable cladribine suppresses the body's ability to make new blood cells (called [[Bone marrow suppression|Myelosuppression]]); data from HCL studies showed that about 70% of people taking the drug had [[Neutropenia|fewer white blood cells]] and about 30% developed infections and some of those progressed to [[septic shock]]; about 40% of people taking the drug had fewer [[red blood cells]] and became severely [[anemia|anemic]];  and about 10% of people had too few [[platelets]].

At the dosage used to treat HCL in two clinical trials, 16% of people had rashes and 22% had nausea, the nausea generally did not lead to vomiting.

The most common adverse effect is mild drowsiness at initial dosing. It is not associated with any withdrawal syndromes or dependence, and is not scheduled in France. In conclusion, etifoxine shows less adverse effects of anterograde amnesia, sedation, impaired psychomotor performance, and withdrawal syndromes than those of benzodiazepines Etifoxine for Pain Patients with Anxiety A recent (2012) review of etifoxine by the French National Pharmacovigilance Committee determined that etifoxine was safe and continued to provide a favorable alternative to benzodiazepine anxiolytics. Contrary to comments in non-refereed on line journals, the committee found (for a ten-year pharmacovigilance period) that safety concerns were rare or very rare and that the incidence of idiosyncratic hepatic problems were very rare (less than drugs like Lipitor).http://ansm.sante.fr/var/ansm_site/storage/original/application/56a2e1cb1dbc986720da09842df11c22.pdf

    <title>Metronidazole</title>

Common [[adverse drug reaction]]s (≥1% of those treated with the drug) associated with systemic metronidazole therapy include: [[nausea]], [[diarrhea]], weight loss, abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, dizziness, and metallic taste in the mouth. [[Intravenous]] administration is commonly associated with [[thrombophlebitis]]. Infrequent adverse effects include: [[hypersensitivity]] reactions (rash, itch, flushing, fever), headache, dizziness, [[vomiting]], [[glossitis]], [[stomatitis]], dark urine, and [[paraesthesia]].  Common adverse drug reaction associated with topical metronidazole therapy include local redness, dryness and skin irritation; and eye watering (if applied near eyes). Metronidazole has been associated with cancer in animal studies.

Metronidazole may cause mood swings. Some evidence from studies in rats indicates the possibility it may contribute to [[serotonin syndrome]], although no case reports documenting this have been published to date.

===Mutagenesis and carcinogenesis===

Metronidazole is listed by the US [[National Toxicology Program]] (NTP) as reasonably anticipated to be a human [[carcinogen]]. Although some of the testing methods have been questioned, oral exposure has been shown to cause cancer in experimental animals and has also demonstrated some mutagenic effects in bacterial cultures. The relationship between exposure to metronidazole and human cancer is unclear. One study {{full citation needed|date=April 2015}} found an excess in lung cancer among women (even after adjusting for smoking), while other studies {{full citation needed|date=April 2015}} found either no increased risk, or a [[Statistical significance|statistically insignificant]] risk.

Metronidazole is listed as a possible carcinogen according to the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]]. A study in those with [[Crohn's disease]] also found chromosomal abnormalities in circulating lymphocytes in people treated with metronidazole.

===Stevens–Johnson syndrome===
Metronidazole alone rarely causes [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]], but is reported to occur at high rates when combined with [[mebendazole]].

It is important to monitor any symptoms of fever or sore throat while taking thiamazole; this could indicate the development of [[agranulocytosis]], an uncommon but severe side effect resulting from a drop in the [[white blood cell]] count (to be specific, [[neutropenia]], a deficiency of [[neutrophils]]).  A complete blood count (CBC) with differential is performed to confirm the suspicion, in which case the drug is discontinued.  Administration of recombinant human [[granulocyte colony-stimulating factor]] (rhG-CSF) may increase recovery.

Other known side effects include:
*skin rash 
*itching 
*abnormal hair loss 
*upset stomach 
*vomiting 
*loss of taste

    <title>Pantoprazole</title>

* Infection: Stomach acid plays a role in killing ingested bacteria. Use of pantoprazole may increase the chance of developing infections such as pneumonia, particularly in hospitalized patients.

===Common===
* Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain (6%), diarrhea (9%), [[flatulence]] (4%), nausea (7%), vomiting (4%)
* Neuromuscular and skeletal: [[arthralgia]] (3%)

===Rare===
* Gastrointestinal: constipation, dry mouth, [[hepatitis]]
* Blood problems: [[leukopenia|low white blood cell count]], [[thrombocytopenia]]
* Immunologic: [[Stevens-Johnson syndrome]], [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]]
* Metabolic: elevated [[creatine kinase]], elevated cholesterol levels, elevated [[liver enzyme]]s (AST/ALT), [[edema|swelling]]
* Musculoskeletal: Muscle disorders, bone fracture and infection, ''[[Clostridium difficile colitis|Clostridium difficile]]'' infection, osteoporosis-related hip fracture, [[rhabdomyolysis]]
* Kidneys: [[interstitial nephritis]]
* Nutrition:  may reduce the absorption of important nutrients, vitamins, and minerals, including certain medications, leaving users at increased risk for pneumonia.

=== Long-term use ===
* [[Osteoporosis]] and [[bone fracture]] have been observed in patients on high-dose and/or long term (over 1 year) prescription [[Proton-pump inhibitor|proton pump inhibitors]].
* [[Hypomagnesia]] has been observed in patients on medications like pantoprazole when taken for longer periods of time (generally 1 year or more, although cases have been reported with regimens as short as 3 months).

=== Discontinuation ===
In people on PPIs for longer than six months, a dose taper should be considered prior to discontinuation. For those on a moderate- to high-dose this can be done by 50 percent every week until on the lowest dose. After a week it can then be stopped.

Some studies have noted flushing, rashes, or minor gastrointestinal problems in some subjects; however, these side effects did not warrant discontinuation of the medication. Some users have reported headaches, especially at doses above 15 milligrams per day, as well as occasional upset stomach. The safety of vinpocetine in pregnant women has not been evaluated. Vinpocetine has been implicated in one case to induce [[agranulocytosis]],{{medrs|date=January 2017}} a serious condition in which [[granulocytes]] are markedly decreased. Some people have anecdotally noted that their continued use of vinpocetine reduces immune function. [[Commission E]] warned that vinpocetine reduced immune function could cause [[apoptosis]] (cellular death) in the long term.

Adverse reactions include decreased appetite, vomiting, [[insomnia]], nausea, dizziness, somnolence, and headache. Many patients report increased alertness with the drug.
Two rare but very serious effects include [[aplastic anemia]] and hepatic (liver) failure. The risk of aplastic anemia is between 1:3,600 and 1:5,000, of which 30% of cases are fatal. The risk of hepatic failure is between 1:24,000 to 1:34,000, of which 40% of cases are fatal.

    <title>Irinotecan</title>

The most significant adverse effects of irinotecan are severe diarrhea and extreme suppression of the immune system.

===Diarrhea===
Irinotecan-associated diarrhea is severe and clinically significant, sometimes leading to severe dehydration requiring hospitalization or intensive care unit admission.  This side-effect is managed with the aggressive use of antidiarrheals such as [[loperamide]] or [[co-phenotrope]] with the first loose bowel movement.

===Immunosuppression===
The immune system is adversely impacted by irinotecan. This is reflected in dramatically lowered [[white blood cell]] counts in the blood, in particular the [[neutrophil]]s. The patient may experience a period of [[neutropenia]] (a clinically significant decrease of neutrophils in the blood) while the bone marrow increases white cell production to compensate.

    <title>Clinafloxacin</title>

The use of clinafloxacin is associated with [[phototoxicity|drug-induced light sensitivity]] (phototoxicity) and [[hypoglycaemia|low blood sugar]]. [[Diarrhea]] has also been reported.

The phototoxicity with clinafloxacin has been more associated with oral dosing as compared to intravenous dosing, though the studies that described this were subject to [[confounding]] by study site (that is, patients that received intravenous clinafloxacin were less mobile, and thereby received less sunlight exposure).

The mechanism for clinafloxacin's phototoxicity involves the [[chlorine]] atom at position 8. In the presence of [[ultraviolet light]], the chemical structure of clinafloxacin is degraded, resulting in the formation of toxic, [[reactive oxygen species]] that can damage cellular structures—including [[DNA]]. For this reason clinafloxacin can also be classified as a [[photocarcinogen]] (a chemical that can cause light-induced cancer), though the risk of developing cancer in humans taking the medication is small.

The mechanism for clinafloxacin's effect on blood glucose is thought to involve stimulation of the pancreatic [[beta cells]], which produce [[insulin]] (a hormone that lowers blood glucose levels).

The symptoms of clinafloxacin overdose are unknown.

It is generally well tolerated following oral doses. Dizziness with or without drowsiness occurs in at least a third of patients, beginning up to three hours after a dose, and usually lasts for up to six hours. Headache and gastrointestinal effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, are also common.

Allergic-type reactions, including urticaria, pruritic skin rashes, and fever, may occur. Liver enzyme values have been raised transiently in some patients. Epileptiform convulsions have been reported, especially in patients with a history of convulsive disorders. Hallucinations and excitement have occurred rarely.

A reddish discoloration of urine, probably due to a metabolite of oxamniquine, has been reported.

Mornidine advertisements for postoperative recovery claimed &quot;unusually low side effects&quot;. However, contemporary comparative trials found that [[hypotension]] (low blood pressure) was a substantial concern when the drug was given at normal dosages for this indication; blood pressure reductions of up to 70&amp;nbsp;mmHg were reported. Reductions in dosage mitigated hypotension while maintaining antiemetic efficacy.

In his book ''The Creation of Psychopharmacology'', Irish psychiatrist [[David Healy (psychiatrist)|David Healy]] states that the failure of pipamazine to perform as a neuroleptic and its negative side effect profile helped Searle lose interest in the antipsychotic sector, and contributed to the company's refusal to market [[haloperidol]] in the United States.

Common side effects of lactulose are abdominal cramping, [[borborygmus]] and [[flatulence]]. In normal individuals, overdose is considered uncomfortable, but not life-threatening. Uncommon side effects are [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]].  In sensitive individuals, such as the elderly or people with reduced [[kidney]] function, excess lactulose dosage can result in [[dehydration]] and electrolyte disturbances such as [[hypomagnesemia|low magnesium levels]].  Ingestion of lactulose does not cause a weight gain because it is nondigestible with no nutritional value. Although lactulose is less likely to cause [[dental caries]] than sucrose, as a sugar there is potential for this. This should be taken into consideration when taken by people with a high susceptibility to this condition.

    <title>Oxazepam</title>

The side effects of oxazepam are similar to those of other benzodiazepines, and may include dizziness, drowsiness, headache, memory impairment, [[Paradoxical reaction|paradoxical excitement]], and [[anterograde amnesia]], but does not affect [[transient global amnesia]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}  Side effects due to rapid decrease in dose or abrupt withdrawal from oxazepam may include abdominal and muscle cramps, convulsions, depression, inability to fall asleep or stay asleep, sweating, tremors, or vomiting.

===Tolerance, dependence and withdrawal===
Oxazepam, as with other benzodiazepine drugs, can cause [[drug tolerance|tolerance]], [[physical dependence]], [[Substance dependence|addiction]], and [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]]. Withdrawal from oxazepam or other benzodiazepines often leads to withdrawal symptoms which are similar to those seen during alcohol and [[barbiturate]] withdrawal. The higher the dose and the longer the drug is taken, the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can occur, though, at standard dosages and also after short-term use. Benzodiazepine treatment should be discontinued as soon as possible by a slow and gradual dose reduction regimen.

It is essential for the administering medical professional to be trained in [[airway management]] with readily available airway equipment because the drug causes significant [[respiratory depression]] and may cause [[respiratory arrest]] if given too rapidly or in too high a dose. Other opioid side effects such as heart rhythm irregularity, blood pressure changes and nausea/vomiting can also be present in patients given this drug and should be dealt with accordingly.

Sufentanil has been associated with extremely rare instances of life-threatening [[anaphylaxis]].

    <title>Cefuroxime</title>

Cefuroxime is generally well-tolerated and its side effects are usually transient. If ingested after food, this antibiotic is both better absorbed and less likely to cause its most common side effects of [[diarrhea]], nausea, vomiting, headaches/[[migraine]]s, dizziness, and abdominal pain compared to most antibiotics in its class.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Although a widely stated cross-allergic risk of about 10% exists between cephalosporins and [[penicillin]], recent assessments have shown no increased risk for a cross-allergic reaction for cefuroxime and several other second-generation or later cephalosporins.

Side effects of midazolam in the elderly are listed above. People experiencing [[Anterograde amnesia|amnesia]] as a side effect of midazolam are generally unaware their memory is impaired, unless they had previously known it as a side effect.

Long-term use of benzodiazepines has been associated with long-lasting deficits of memory, and show only partial recovery six months after stopping benzodiazepines. It is unclear whether full recovery occurs after longer periods of abstinence. Benzodiazepines can cause or worsen depression. Paradoxical excitement occasionally occurs with benzodiazepines, including a worsening of seizures. Children and elderly individuals or those with a history of alcohol abuse and individuals with a history of aggressive behavior or anger are at increased risk of paradoxical effects. [[Paradoxical reaction]]s are particularly associated with intravenous administration. After nighttime administration of midazolam, residual 'hangover' effects, such as sleepiness and impaired psychomotor and [[cognitive]] functions, may persist into the next day. This may impair the ability of users to drive safely and may increase the risk of falls and [[hip fractures]]. Sedation, [[respiratory depression]] and [[hypotension]] due to a reduction in systematic vascular resistance, and an increase in heart rate can occur. If intravenous midazolam is given too quickly, hypotension may occur. A &quot;midazolam infusion syndrome&quot; may result from high doses, and is characterised by delayed arousal hours to days after discontinuation of midazolam, and may lead to an increase in the length of ventilatory support needed.

In susceptible individuals, midazolam has been known to cause a paradoxical reaction, a well-documented complication with benzodiazepines. When this occurs, the individual may experience anxiety, involuntary movements, aggressive or violent behavior, uncontrollable crying or verbalization, and other similar effects. This seems to be related to the altered state of consciousness or [[disinhibition]] produced by the drug. Paradoxical behavior is often not recalled by the patient due to the amnesia-producing properties of the drug. In extreme situations, flumazenil can be administered to inhibit or reverse the effects of midazolam.  Antipsychotic medications, such as [[haloperidol]], have also been used for this purpose.

Midazolam is known to cause respiratory depression. In healthy humans, 0.15&amp;nbsp;mg/kg of midazolam may cause respiratory depression, which is postulated to be a [[central nervous system]] (CNS) effect. When midazolam is administered in combination with fentanyl, the incidence of hypoxemia or apnea becomes more likely. Potential drug interactions involving at least one CNS depressant were observed for 84% of midazolam users who were subsequently required to receive the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil.

===Pregnancy and breastfeeding===
Midazolam, when taken during the [[third trimester]] of pregnancy, may cause risk to the neonate, including benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, with possible symptoms including [[hypotonia]], [[apnoeic]] spells, [[cyanosis]], and impaired [[metabolic]] responses to cold stress. Symptoms of hypotonia and the neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome have been reported to persist from hours to months after birth. Other [[neonatal withdrawal]] symptoms include hyperexcitability, tremor, and gastrointestinal upset (diarrhea or vomiting). [[Breastfeeding]] by mothers using midazolam is not recommended.

===Tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal===
A benzodiazepine dependence occurs in about one-third of individuals who are treated with benzodiazepines for longer than 4 weeks, which typically results in tolerance and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome when the dose is reduced too rapidly. Midazolam infusions may induce tolerance and a withdrawal syndrome in a matter of days. The risk factors for dependence include dependent personality, use of a benzodiazepine that is short-acting, high potency and long-term use of benzodiazepines. Withdrawal symptoms from midazolam can range from insomnia and anxiety to seizures and psychosis. Withdrawal symptoms can sometimes resemble a person’s underlying condition. Gradual reduction of midazolam after regular use can minimise withdrawal and [[rebound effects]]. Tolerance and the resultant withdrawal syndrome may be due to receptor down-regulation and [[GABAA receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]] alterations in gene expression, which causes long-term changes in the function of the GABAergic neuronal system.

Chronic users of benzodiazepine medication who are given midazolam experience reduced therapeutic effects of midazolam, due to tolerance to benzodiazepines. Prolonged infusions with midazolam results in the development of tolerance; if midazolam is given for a few days or more a withdrawal syndrome can occur. Therefore, preventing a withdrawal syndrome requires that a prolonged infusion be gradually withdrawn, and sometimes, continued tapering of dose with an oral long-acting benzodiazepine such as [[clorazepate dipotassium]]. When signs of tolerance to midazolam occur during intensive care unit sedation the addition of an opioid or propofol is recommended. Withdrawal symptoms can include [[irritability]], abnormal [[reflexes]], [[tremor]]s, [[clonus]], [[hypertonicity]], [[delirium]] and [[seizures]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]], [[tachycardia]], [[hypertension]], and [[tachypnea]]. While effective in reversing the effects of benzodiazepines it is not used in most cases as it may trigger seizures in mixed overdoses and benzodiazepine dependent individuals.

===Detection in body fluids===
Concentrations of midazolam or its major metabolite, 1-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide, may be measured in plasma, serum, or whole blood to monitor for safety in those receiving the drug therapeutically, to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients, or to assist in a forensic investigation of a case of fatal overdosage. Patients with renal dysfunction may exhibit prolongation of elimination half-life for both the parent drug and its active metabolite, with accumulation of these two substances in the bloodstream and the appearance of adverse depressant effects. Midazolam is metabolized almost completely by [[CYP3A4|cytochrome P450-3A4]]. [[Atorvastatin]] administration along with midazolam results in a reduced elimination rate of midazolam. St John's wort decreases the blood levels of midazolam. Grapefruit juice reduces intestinal 3A4 and results in less metabolism and higher plasma concentrations.

The following [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]]s were noted under treatment with tirofiban and heparin (and aspirin, if tolerated). Other drugs were used as necessary.

The major adverse effect is bleeding on local sites of clinical intervention and systemically (regarding parts of the body or the whole body system). Major bleeding has occurred in 1.4% of patients and minor bleeding in 10.5%. [[Blood transfusion|Transfusion]]s were required to terminate bleeding and to improve bleeding-related [[anemia]] in 4.0% of all patients. Geriatric patients have experienced more bleeding episodes than younger, women more than men.

Thrombocytopenia was more often seen in the tirofiban + heparin group (1.5%) than in the heparin control group (0.8%). This adverse effect was usually readily reversible within days.

Positive fecal and urine hemoglobin tests have also been reported.

[[Postmarketing surveillance|Post-marketing event]]s have been the occurrence of intracranial bleeding, retroperitoneal bleeding, [[pulmonary hemorrhage]] and spinal-epidural hematoma. Fatal bleedings have been reported rarely.

Sometimes, thrombocytopenia was associated with [[chills]], low-grade [[fever]] or bleeding complications (see above).

Cases of hypersenitivity including acute [[anaphylaxis]] have been seen.

Side effects are similar to other prostaglandin analogs applied to the eye. The most common one is [[conjunctival hyperemia]], which occurs in more than 10% of patients. Other effects include blurred vision, eye and eyelid redness, eye burning or other discomfort, and permanent darkening of the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] to brown.

Some side effects are specific to the cosmetic formulation, which is applied to the skin at the base of the eyelash rather than instilled into the eye. These include infection if the one-time applicators are reused, and darkening of the eyelid or of the area beneath the eye. Research suggests that wiping the eye with an absorbent pad after the administration of eye drops can result in shorter eyelashes and a lesser chance of hyperpigmentation in the eyelid, compared to not wiping off excess fluid.

    <title>Amphetamine</title>

&lt;noinclude&gt;The [[side effect]]s of amphetamine are many and varied, and the amount of amphetamine used is the primary factor in determining the likelihood and severity of side effects. Amphetamine products such as [[Adderall]], Dexedrine, and their generic equivalents are currently approved by the USFDA for long-term therapeutic use. [[Recreational drug use#Stimulants|Recreational use]] of amphetamine generally involves much larger doses, which have a greater risk of serious side effects than dosages used for therapeutic reasons.&lt;/noinclude&gt;

===Physical===
At normal therapeutic doses, the physical side effects of amphetamine vary widely by age and from person to person. [[Cardiovascular]] side effects can include [[hypertension]] or [[hypotension]] from a [[vasovagal response]], [[Raynaud's phenomenon]] (reduced blood flow to the hands and feet), and [[tachycardia]] (increased heart rate). Abdominal side effects may include [[abdominal pain]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|appetite loss]], [[nausea]], and [[weight loss]].DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS&lt;br /&gt;Extended-release oral suspension contains 2.5 mg amphetamine base per mL.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other potential side effects include [[blurred vision]], [[xerostomia|dry mouth]], [[bruxism|excessive grinding of the teeth]], nosebleed, profuse sweating, [[rhinitis medicamentosa]] (drug-induced nasal congestion), reduced [[seizure threshold]], and [[tics]] (a type of movement disorder).{{#tag:ref| – Nasal decongestants:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; – Sympathomimetic:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Amphetamine}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;sources&quot;}} Dangerous physical side effects are rare at typical pharmaceutical doses.

Amphetamine stimulates the [[Respiratory center|medullary respiratory centers]], producing faster and deeper breaths. Amphetamine also induces [[Muscle contraction|contraction]] in the urinary [[Detrusor muscle|bladder sphincter]], the muscle which controls urination, which can result in difficulty urinating. This effect can be useful in treating [[enuresis|bed wetting]] and [[urinary incontinence|loss of bladder control]]. The effects of amphetamine on the gastrointestinal tract are unpredictable. If intestinal activity is high, amphetamine may reduce [[gastrointestinal motility]] (the rate at which content moves through the digestive system); however, amphetamine may increase motility when the [[smooth muscle tissue|smooth muscle]] of the tract is relaxed. Amphetamine also has a slight [[analgesic]] effect and can enhance the pain relieving effects of [[opioid]]s.

USFDA-commissioned studies from 2011 indicate that in children, young adults, and adults there is no association between serious adverse cardiovascular events ([[sudden cardiac death|sudden death]], [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], and [[stroke]]) and the medical use of amphetamine or other ADHD stimulants.{{#tag:ref||group=&quot;sources&quot;}}

===Psychological===
At normal therapeutic doses, the most common psychological side effects of amphetamine include increased [[alertness]], apprehension, [[concentration]], initiative, [[self-confidence]], and sociability, mood swings ([[euphoria|elated mood]] followed by mildly [[dysphoria|depressed mood]]), [[insomnia]] or [[wakefulness]], and decreased sense of fatigue. Less common side effects include [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]], change in [[libido]], [[grandiosity]], [[irritability]], repetitive or [[Fixation (psychology)|obsessive]] behaviors, and restlessness;{{#tag:ref| [[Amphetamine psychosis]] (e.g., [[delusion]]s and [[paranoia]]) can occur in heavy users. Although very rare, this psychosis can also occur at therapeutic doses during long-term therapy.

Amphetamine has also been shown to produce a [[conditioned place preference]] in humans taking therapeutic doses,

    <title>Levofloxacin</title>

While its side effects are typically mild to moderate, serious reactions to levofloxacin sometimes occur.

Prominent among these are side effects that became the subject of a [[black box warning]] by the FDA in 2016.  Such injuries, including tendon rupture, has been observed up to 6 months after cessation of treatment; the elderly, transplant patients, and those with a current or historical [[corticosteroid]] use are at elevated risk. A detailed overview of risk factors for fluoroquinolone-associated tendon rupture has been published; advanced age, concurrent treatment with corticosteroids, and higher doses of fluoroquinolone appear to be the most important risk factors. The U.S. label for levofloxacin also contains a black box warning for the exacerbation of the symptoms of the neurological disease [[myasthenia gravis]].

Increasing age and concomitant corticosteroid use appears to increase the risk of musculoskeletal complications.

A wide variety of other uncommon but serious adverse events have been associated with fluoroquinolone use, with varying degrees of evidence supporting causation. These include anaphylaxis, hepatotoxicity, central nervous system effects including seizures and psychiatric effects, prolongation of the [[QT interval]], blood glucose disturbances, and [[photosensitivity]], among others.  Levofloxacin may produce fewer of these rare serious adverse effects than other fluoroquinolones.

There is some disagreement in the medical literature regarding whether and to what extent levofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones produce serious adverse effects more frequently than other broad spectrum antibacterial drugs.

With regard to more usual side effects, in pooled results from 7537 patients exposed to levofloxacin in 29 clinical trials, 4.3% discontinued treatment due to adverse drug reactions.  The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were gastrointestinal, including nausea, vomiting, and constipation. Overall, 7% of patients experienced nausea, 6% headache, 5% diarrhea, 4% insomnia, along with other adverse reactions experienced at lower rates.

Administration of levofloxacin or other broad spectrum antibiotics is associated with ''[[Clostridium difficile colitis|Clostridium difficile]]'' associated diarrhea which may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Fluoroquinoline administration may be associated with the acquisition and outgrowth of a particularly virulent ''Clostridium'' strain.

    <title>Toremifene</title>

The [[side effect]]s of toremifene are similar to those of tamoxifen. The most common side effect is [[hot flash]]es. Other side effects include [[sweating]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[dizziness]], [[vaginal discharge]], and [[vaginal bleeding]]. Toremifene has a small risk of [[thromboembolism|thromboembolic event]]s. [[Cataract]]s, [[visual impairment|vision changes]], and [[elevated transaminases|elevation of liver enzymes]] have been reported. The drug [[drug-induced QT prolongation|prolongs the QT interval]] and hence has a risk of potentially fatal [[Heart arrhythmia|dysrhythmia]]s. The risk of dysrhythmias can be reduced by avoiding use in patients with [[hypokalemia]], [[hypomagnesemia]], pre-existing QT prolongation, and in those taking other QT-prolonging drugs. Because toremifene has [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]]ic actions in the [[uterus]], it can increase the risk of [[endometrial hyperplasia]] and [[endometrial cancer]].

In [[clinical trial]]s, the most common [[Adverse drug reaction|adverse effects]] of sildenafil use included [[headache]], [[Flushing (physiology)|flushing]], [[indigestion]], [[nasal congestion]], and impaired vision, including [[photophobia]] and blurred vision. Some sildenafil users have complained of seeing everything tinted blue ([[cyanopsia]]). Some complained of blurriness and loss of [[peripheral vision]]. In July 2005, the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] found that sildenafil could lead to vision impairment in rare cases and a number of studies have linked sildenafil use with [[Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy|non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy]]. In October 2007, the FDA announced that the labeling for all [[PDE5]] inhibitors, including sildenafil, required a more prominent warning of the potential risk of sudden hearing loss.

===Interactions===
Care should be exercised by people who are also taking [[Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease inhibitors]] for the treatment of [[HIV/AIDS|HIV infection]]. Protease inhibitors inhibit the metabolism of sildenafil, effectively multiplying the plasma levels of sildenafil, increasing the incidence and severity of side effects. Those using protease inhibitors are recommended to limit their use of sildenafil to no more than one 25 mg dose every 48 hours. Other drugs that interfere with the metabolism of sildenafil include [[erythromycin]] and [[cimetidine]], both of which can also lead to prolonged plasma half-life levels.

The use of sildenafil and an [[Alpha-1 blocker|α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; blocker]] (typically prescribed for [[hypertension]] or for urologic conditions, such as [[benign prostatic hypertrophy]]) at the same time may lead to low blood pressure, but this effect does not occur if they are taken at least 4 hours apart.{{rp|11}}

** [[alkyl nitrites]] (commonly known as &quot;[[poppers]]&quot;)

===Acute toxicity===
Oral {{LD50}} levels in mice and rats are 3547–2545&amp;nbsp;mg/kg body weight (male and female) and 474–365 (male and female), respectively.

===Genotoxicity and mutagenicity===
Mutation studies in [[prokaryote]]s and [[eukaryote]]s show that ractopamine is not mutagenic. However, the results of several ''in vitro'' studies, including chromosome aberration tests in human lymphocytes, are positive. The positive genotoxic results are explained with limited evidence to be due to a secondary auto-oxidative mechanism from ractopamine-catechol-producing reactive intermediates.{{Which|date=April 2013}}{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Carcinogenicity===
Ractopamine is not considered to be a carcinogen and not listed by [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|IARC]], [[National Toxicology Program|NTP]], [[ACGIH]], or [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]]. The observation benign [[leiomyomas]] (tumors of smooth muscle) in mice and rats could be due to a general feature of beta-adrenergic activity of ractopamine.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Cardiovascular effects===
Dose-dependent changes of heart rate and cardiac output are observed within the first hour after administration of ractopamine and gradually return to baseline values. The systolic blood pressure will also increase in a dose-dependent manner, while the diastolic pressure remains unchanged.

===Musculoskeletal effects===
Skeletal muscle tremor is the most common adverse effect of beta-agonists, and is more likely to be seen after oral administration than after inhalation. Tremor results from an imbalance between fast- and slow-twitch muscle groups of the extremities, and its severity varies greatly between individuals. No such effects were recorded at the [[no-observed-adverse-effect level]] determined in the toxicological studies conducted in laboratory animals given ractopamine or in the study in humans on cardiovascular effects of ractopamine.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Behavioral changes in humans===
Restlessness, apprehension, and anxiety were reported effects after the use of various beta-agonists, particularly after oral or parenteral treatment. In pilot clinical trials with ractopamine, four patients showed little evidence for central nervous system stimulation. Whether long-term treatment with these drugs results in the development of tolerance to these adverse effects is unclear.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

[[Image:VIOXX sample blister pack.jpg|right|100px]]Aside from the reduced incidence of gastric ulceration, rofecoxib exhibits a similar adverse effect profile to other [[NSAID]]s.
Prostaglandin is a large family of lipids. Prostaglandin I2/PGI2/prostacyclin is just one member of it. Prostaglandins other than PGI2 (such as PGE2) also play important roles in vascular tone regulation. Prostacyclin/thromboxane are produced by both COX-1 and COX-2, and rofecoxib suppresses just COX-2 enzyme, so there is no reason to believe that prostacyclin levels are significantly reduced by the drug. And there is no reason to believe that only the balance between quantities of prostacyclin and thromboxane is the determinant factor for vascular tone. Indeed, Merck has stated that there was no effect on prostacyclin production in blood vessels in animal testing. [[Elias James Corey|Corey]] speculated that the cardiotoxicity may be associated with an [[organic acid anhydride]] formed when rofecoxib is exposed to air.

===Heart and blood vessels===

====VIGOR study and publishing controversy====
The VIGOR (Vioxx GI Outcomes Research) study, conducted by Bombardier, et al., which compared the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of rofecoxib and naproxen, had indicated a significant 4-fold increased risk of acute [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack) in rofecoxib patients when compared with [[naproxen]] patients (0.4% vs 0.1%, [[relative risk|RR]] 0.25) over the 12-month span of the study. The elevated risk began during the second month on rofecoxib. There was no significant difference in the mortality from cardiovascular events between the two groups, nor was there any significant difference in the rate of myocardial infarction between the rofecoxib and naproxen treatment groups in patients without high cardiovascular risk. The difference in overall risk was by the patients at higher risk of heart attack, i.e. those meeting the criteria for low-dose aspirin prophylaxis of secondary cardiovascular events (previous myocardial infarction, angina, [[cerebrovascular accident]], [[transient ischemic attack]], or [[coronary artery bypass graft|coronary artery bypass]]).

Merck's scientists interpreted the finding as a protective effect of naproxen, telling the FDA that the difference in heart attacks &quot;is primarily due to&quot; this protective effect.

Some scientists have accused the ''NEJM'' editorial board of making unfounded accusations. Others have applauded the editorial. Renowned research cardiologist [[Eric Topol]], a prominent Merck critic, accused Merck of &quot;manipulation of data&quot; and said &quot;I think now the scientific misconduct trial is really fully backed up&quot;. Phil Fontanarosa, executive editor of the prestigious ''Journal of the American Medical Association'', welcomed the editorial, saying &quot;this is another in the long list of recent examples that have generated real concerns about trust and confidence in industry-sponsored studies&quot;.

On May 15, 2006, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that a late night email, written by an outside public relations specialist and sent to ''Journal'' staffers hours before the Expression of Concern was released, predicted that &quot;the rebuke would divert attention to Merck and induce the media to ignore the ''New England Journal of Medicine''{{'}}s own role in aiding Vioxx sales.&quot; Investigations revealed that Merck had several years worth of information suggesting an elevated risk of cardiac events, and Vice President [[Edward Scolnick]] took much of the blame for the suppression of this information.

====Alzheimer's disease====
In 2000 and 2001, Merck conducted several studies of rofecoxib aimed at determining if the drug slowed the onset of Alzheimer's disease. Merck has placed great emphasis on these studies on the grounds that they are relatively large (almost 3000 patients) and compared rofecoxib to a placebo rather than to another pain reliever. These studies found an elevated death rate among rofecoxib patients, although the deaths were not generally heart-related. However, they did not find any elevated cardiovascular risk due to rofecoxib. Before 2004, Merck cited these studies as providing evidence, contrary to VIGOR, of rofecoxib's safety.

====Premenstrual acne====
A 2003 placebo-controlled small short-term study in India of 80 women with premenstrual [[acne vulgaris]] acne, were given rofecoxib or placebo for 2 cycles of 10 days suggest that &quot;rofecoxib is effective in the management of premenstrual acne.

====APPROVe study====
In 2001, Merck commenced the APPROVe (Adenomatous Polyp PRevention On Vioxx) study, a three-year trial with the primary aim of evaluating the efficacy of rofecoxib for the [[prophylaxis]] of [[polyp (medicine)|colorectal polyps]]. [[Celecoxib]] had already been approved for this indication, and it was hoped to add this to the indications for rofecoxib as well. An additional aim of the study was to further evaluate the cardiovascular safety of rofecoxib.

The APPROVe study was terminated early when the preliminary data from the study showed an increased relative [[risk]] of adverse thrombotic cardiovascular events (including [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and [[stroke]]), beginning after 18 months of rofecoxib therapy. In patients taking rofecoxib, versus [[placebo]], the relative risk of these events was 1.92 (rofecoxib 1.50 events vs placebo 0.78 events per 100 patient years). The results from the first 18 months of the APPROVe study did not show an increased relative risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Moreover, overall and cardiovascular mortality rates were similar between the rofecoxib and placebo populations. Although this was a relatively small study and only the last result was statistically significant, critics have charged that this early finding should have prompted Merck to quickly conduct larger studies of rofecoxib's cardiovascular safety. Merck notes that it had already begun VIGOR at the time Study 090 was completed. Although VIGOR was primarily designed to demonstrate new uses for rofecoxib, it also collected data on adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

Several very large observational studies have also found elevated risk of heart attack from rofecoxib. For example, a recent retrospective study of 113,000 elderly Canadians suggested a borderline statistically significant increased relative risk of heart attacks of 1.24 from Vioxx usage, with a relative risk of 1.73 for higher-dose Vioxx usage. (Levesque, 2005). Another study, using [[Kaiser Permanente]] data, found a 1.47 relative risk for low-dose Vioxx usage and 3.58 for high-dose Vioxx usage compared to current use of celecoxib, though the smaller number was not statistically significant, and relative risk compared to other populations was not statistically significant. (Graham, 2005).

Furthermore, a more recent meta-study of 114 randomized trials with a total of 116,000+ participants, published in JAMA, showed that Vioxx uniquely increased risk of renal (kidney) disease, and heart arrhythmia. although smaller studies had demonstrated such effects earlier with the use of celecoxib, valdecoxib and parecoxib.

Nevertheless, it is likely that trials of newer drugs in the category will be extended in order to supply additional evidence of cardiovascular safety. Examples are some more specific COX-2 inhibitors, including [[etoricoxib]] (Arcoxia) and [[lumiracoxib]] (Prexige), which are currently (circa 2005) undergoing Phase III/IV [[clinical trial]]s.

Besides, regulatory authorities worldwide now require warnings about cardiovascular risk of COX-2 inhibitors still on the market. For example, in 2005, EU regulators required the following changes to the product information and/or packaging of all COX-2 inhibitors:

* Contraindications stating that COX-2 inhibitors must not be used in patients with established ischaemic heart disease and/or cerebrovascular disease (stroke), and also in patients with peripheral arterial disease
* Reinforced warnings to healthcare professionals to exercise caution when prescribing COX-2 inhibitors to patients with risk factors for heart disease, such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia (high cholesterol levels), diabetes and smoking
* Given the association between cardiovascular risk and exposure to COX-2 inhibitors, doctors are advised to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration of treatment

====Other NSAIDs====
Since the withdrawal of Vioxx it has come to light that there may be negative cardiovascular effects with not only other COX-2 inhibitiors, but even the majority of other NSAIDs. It is only with the recent development of drugs like Vioxx that drug companies have carried out the kind of well executed trials that could establish such effects and these sort of trials have never been carried out in older &quot;trusted&quot; NSAIDs such as [[ibuprofen]], [[diclofenac]] and others. The possible exceptions may be [[aspirin]] and [[naproxen]] due to their anti-platelet aggregation properties.

Hydroxychloroquine can worsen existing cases of both [[psoriasis]] and [[porphyria]].

===Eyes===
{{Main article|Chloroquine retinopathy}}
One of the most serious side effects is a toxicity in the eye (generally with chronic use). People taking 400&amp;nbsp;mg of hydroxychloroquine or less per day generally have a negligible risk of [[Macula of retina|macular]] toxicity, whereas the risk begins to go up when a person takes the medication over 5 years or has a cumulative dose of more than 1000&amp;nbsp;grams. The daily safe maximum dose for eye toxicity can be computed from one's height and weight using this [http://www.eyedock.com/index.php?option=com_jumi&amp;fileid=8&amp;Itemid=73 calculator]. Cumulative doses can also be calculated from this calculator. Macular toxicity is related to the total cumulative dose rather than the daily dose. Regular eye screening, even in the absence of visual symptoms, is recommended to begin when either of these risk factors occurs.

Toxicity from hydroxychloroquine may be seen in two distinct areas of the eye: the [[cornea]] and the macula. The cornea may become affected (relatively commonly) by an innocuous [[cornea verticillata]] or vortex keratopathy and is characterized by whorl-like corneal epithelial deposits. These changes bear no relationship to dosage and are usually reversible on cessation of hydroxychloroquine.

The macular changes are potentially serious and are related to dosage and length of time taking hydroxychloroquine. Advanced retinopathy is characterized by reduction of visual acuity and a &quot;bull's eye&quot; macular lesion which is absent in early involvement.

The most common adverse reactions encountered in Phase II and Phase III trials were nausea (5.5%), headache (4.7%), and diarrhea (4.4%), as well as rash (2.7%) and itchiness (2.1%).  Other less frequent but serious adverse reactions included hematologic disorders, hepatotoxicity, ''Clostridium difficile'' colitis, bronchospasm, infusion-related reactions including [[Red man syndrome (Drug eruption)|Red Man Syndrome]], and anaphylactic shock.  In trials, dalbavancin was associated with higher rates of hemorrhagic events compared to comparator groups and should be a precaution in patients undergoing surgery or taking anticoagulants.  Patients on dalbavancin also had post-baseline alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels that were 3 times the upper normal limit, some even having elevations 10 times the upper normal limit; however, eight of the twelve dalbavancin-treated patients had comorbid conditions that could affect their ALT, compared to only one patient in the comparator group.  There is no evidence of ototoxicity associated with dalbavancin.

===Drug interactions===
Clinical drug-drug interactions with dalbavancin have not been studied, and dalbavancin does not appear to interact with cytochrome P450 substrates, inhibitors, or inducers. It was found to have an ''in vitro'' synergistic interaction with the antimicrobial oxacillin, but the clinical significance of this interaction has yet to be established.

===Pregnancy and lactation===
Use of dalbavancin in pregnant women has not been studied sufficiently and should only occur when the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.  Animal studies did not show embryo or fetal toxicity at doses that were 1.2 and 0.7 times the human dose.  However, delayed fetal maturation was observed at a dose that was 3.5 times the human dose.  While dalbavancin is excreted in rat milk, it is unknown if it is excreted in human milk.  It should be used in nursing mothers only when the potential benefit exceeds the potential risk.  There is no evidence in animals of teratogenicity.

Several reactions have been noted in manufacturer guidelines — deep sleep, incoordination, sedation, calmness, and dizziness have been reported in children and adults, as well as others such as [[hypotension]], [[tinnitus]], and headaches.

Central nervous system problems such as hallucinations or confusion have been observed in rare cases, attributed mostly to overdosage.  Such properties have been attributed to hydroxyzine in several cases, particularly in patients treated for neuropsychological disorders, as well as in cases where overdoses have been observed. While there are reports of the &quot;hallucinogenic&quot; or &quot;hypnotic&quot; properties of hydroxyzine, several clinical data trials have not reported such side effects from the sole consumption of hydroxyzine, but rather, have described its overall calming effect described through the stimulation of areas within the [[formatio reticularis]]. The hallucinogenic or hypnotic properties have been described as being an additional effect from overall [[central nervous system]] suppression by other CNS agents, such as [[Lithium pharmacology|lithium]] or [[ethanol]].

The effect of hydroxyzine has also been tested on the ability of humans in the registration and storage of memory, and was used in comparison with relatively safe drugs, such as lorazepam, to illustrate the effects of benzodiazepines, which are thought to have adverse effects on the capacity of memory storage. Hydroxyzine was found to have no adverse effects on memory in relation to [[lorazepam]], which caused several deficiencies in the capacity of memory storage.

[[Somnolence]] with or without vivid dreams or nightmares may occur in users with antihistamine sensitivities in combination with other CNS depressants. Hydroxyzine exhibits [[anxiolytic]] and [[sedative]] properties in many psychiatric patients. Other studies have suggested that hydroxyzine acts as an acute hypnotic, reducing [[sleep onset latency]] and increasing sleep duration — also showing that some drowsiness did occur. This was observed more in female patients, who also had greater hypnotic response.

Because of potential for more severe side effects, this drug is on the list to avoid in the elderly.

In 2015, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) announced a small but definite risk of QT prolongation associated with the use of hydroxyzine.
This side effect is more likely to occur in people with pre-existing cardiac disease, or with the use of other medicines known to prolong the QT interval.

 effects of treatments on the market. This led to many other patents over the years, a few of which are listed in the table below:

    <title>Zolpidem</title>

[[File:Ambien-pictures.jpg|thumb|upright|Various zolpidem pills]]
The most common side effects for short-term use include headache (reported by 7% of people in clinical trials) drowsiness (2%), dizziness (1%), and diarrhea (1%); the most common side effects of long-term use included dry mouth (3%),  allergy (4%), back pain (3%), flu-like symptoms (1%),  chest pain (1%),  heart palpitations (2%),  drowsiness (8%), dizziness (5%), lethargy (3%), drugged feeling (3%),  lightheadedness (2%),  depression (1%),  abnormal dreams (1%), amnesia (1%),  sleep disorder (1%),  diarrhea (3%),  abdominal pain (2%),  constipation (2%), sinusitis (4%), sore throat (3%), and rash (2%).

Some users have reported unexplained [[sleepwalking]] [[night eating syndrome]] while asleep, and performing other daily tasks while sleeping. Research by Australia's [[National Prescribing Service]] found these events occur mostly after the first dose taken, or within a few days of starting therapy. Rare reports of [[Sleep sex|sexual parasomnia]] (sleep sex) episodes related to zolpidem intake have also been reported.

In February 2008, the Australian [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]] attached a [[boxed warning]] to zolpidem, stating that &quot;Zolpidem may be associated with potentially dangerous complex sleep-related behaviours that may include sleep walking, sleep driving, and other bizarre behaviours. Zolpidem is not to be taken with [[alcoholic beverage]]s. Caution is needed with other CNS-depressant drugs.  Limit use to four weeks maximum under close medical supervision.&quot;

===Tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal===
[[File:Stilnoct2.JPG|thumb|Ambien tablets]]
A review medical publication found long-term use of zolpidem is associated with [[drug tolerance]], [[substance dependence]], [[rebound insomnia]], and [[central nervous system|CNS]]-related adverse effects. It was recommended that zolpidem be used for short periods of time using the lowest effective dose. Zolpidem 10&amp;nbsp;mg is effective in treating insomnia when used intermittently no fewer than three and no more than five pills per week for a period of 12 weeks.

Nonpharmacological treatment options (e.g. [[cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia]]), however, were found to have sustained improvements in sleep quality. Animal studies of the [[drug tolerance|tolerance]]-inducing properties have shown that in rodents, zolpidem has less tolerance-producing potential than [[benzodiazepines]], but in primates the tolerance-producing potential of zolpidem was the same as that of benzodiazepines.
Tolerance  to the effects of zolpidem can develop in some people in just a few weeks. Abrupt withdrawal may cause [[delirium]], seizures, or other severe effects, especially if used for prolonged periods and at high dosages.

When drug tolerance and physical dependence to zolpidem has developed, treatment usually entails a gradual dose reduction over a period of months to minimise withdrawal symptoms, which can resemble those seen during [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome|benzodiazepine withdrawal]]. Failing that, an alternative method may be necessary for some patients, such as a switch to a [[benzodiazepine equivalent]] dose of a longer-acting benzodiazepine drug, such as [[diazepam]] or [[chlordiazepoxide]], followed by a gradual reduction in dosage of the long-acting [[benzodiazepine]]. Sometimes for difficult-to-treat patients, an inpatient [[flumazenil]] rapid detoxification program can be used to detoxify from a zolpidem [[drug dependence]] or [[Substance use disorder|addiction]].

Alcohol has [[cross tolerance]] with GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor positive modulators such as the [[benzodiazepines]] and the [[nonbenzodiazepine]] drugs. For this reason, alcoholics or recovering alcoholics may be at increased risk of [[physical dependency]] on zolpidem. Also, alcoholics and recreational drug users may have an increased likelihood of recreationally using and or becoming psychologically dependent on zolpidem. It is not typically prescribed in those with a history of [[alcoholism]], [[drug misuse|recreational drug use]], [[physical dependency]], or [[Substance dependence|psychological dependency]] on sedative-hypnotic drugs. Zolpidem has rarely been associated with [[drug-seeking behavior]],{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} the likelihood of which is amplified in patients with a history of recreational use of drugs or alcohol.

===Overdose===
An overdose of zolpidem may cause excessive sedation, pin-point pupils, or depressed respiratory function, which may progress to coma, and possibly death. Combined with alcohol, opiates, or other [[Central nervous system|CNS]] depressants, it may be even more likely to lead to fatal overdoses. Zolpidem overdosage can be treated with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist [[flumazenil]], which displaces zolpidem from its binding site on the benzodiazepine receptor to rapidly reverse the effects of the zolpidem.

===Detection in body fluids===
Zolpidem may be quantitated in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients, provide evidence in an impaired driving arrest, or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma zolpidem concentrations are usually in a range of 30–300&amp;nbsp;μg/l in persons receiving the drug therapeutically, 100–700&amp;nbsp;μg/l in those arrested for impaired driving, and 1000–7000&amp;nbsp;μg/l in victims of acute overdosage. Analytical techniques, in general, involve gas or liquid [[chromatography]].

If ipratropium is inhaled, side effects resembling those of other [[anticholinergic]]s are minimal. However, dry mouth and sedation have been reported. Also, effects such as skin flushing, tachycardia, acute angle-closure glaucoma, nausea, palpitations and headache have been observed. Inhaled ipratropium does not decrease [[mucociliary clearance]]. The inhalation itself can cause headache and irritation of the throat in a few percent of patients.

Urinary retention has been reported in patients receiving doses by nebulizer. As a result, caution may be warranted, especially by  men with prostatic hypertrophy.

    <title>Liraglutide</title>


===Thyroid cancer concerns===
At exposures eight times greater than those used in humans, liraglutide caused a statistically significant increase in thyroid tumors in rats.  The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown.

The FDA said serum calcitonin, a biomarker of medullary thyroid cancer, was slightly increased in liraglutide patients, but still within normal ranges, and it required ongoing monitoring for 15 years in a cancer registry.

===Pancreatitis concerns===
In 2013, a group at [[Johns Hopkins]] reported an apparently statistically significant association between hospitalization for acute pancreatitis and prior treatment with GLP-1 derivatives (such as exenatide) and DPP-4 inhibitors (such as sitagliptin). &lt;!-- In 2013, a study conducted at UCLA reported a &quot;marked expansion&quot; of the pancreas in eight organ donors who had been treated with incretin mimetic drugs such as Victoza and Byetta.--&gt;  In response, the United States FDA and the European Medicines Agency conducted a review of all available data regarding the possible connection between incretin mimetics and pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer.  In a joint 2014 letter to the New England Journal of Medicine, the agencies concluded that &quot;A pooled analysis of data from 14,611 patients with type 2 diabetes from 25 clinical trials in the sitagliptin database provided no compelling evidence of an increased risk of pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer&quot; and &quot;Both agencies agree that assertions concerning a causal association between incretin-based drugs and pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer, as expressed recently in the scientific literature and in the media, are inconsistent with the current data. The FDA and the EMA have not reached a final conclusion at this time regarding such a causal relationship. Although the totality of the data that have been reviewed provides reassurance, pancreatitis will continue to be considered a risk associated with these drugs until more data are available; both agencies continue to investigate this safety signal.&quot;

    <title>Trastuzumab</title>


Some of the common side effects of trastuzumab are flu-like symptoms (such as fever, chills and mild pain), [[nausea]] and [[diarrhea]]. In 2-7% of cases, trastuzumab is associated with cardiac dysfunction, which includes [[congestive heart failure]]. As a result, regular cardiac screening with either a [[MUGA scan]] or [[echocardiography]] is commonly undertaken during the trastuzumab treatment period. The decline in ejection fraction appears to be reversible.

Trastuzumab downregulates neuregulin-1 (NRG-1), which is essential for the activation of cell survival pathways in cardiomyocytes and the maintenance of cardiac function. NRG-1 activates the MAPK pathway and the PI3K/AKT pathway as well as focal adhesion kinases (FAK). These are all significant for the function and structure of cardiomyocytes. Trastuzumab can therefore lead to cardiac dysfunction.

Approximately 10% of people are unable to tolerate the drug because of pre-existing heart problems; physicians are balancing the risk of recurrent cancer against the higher risk of death due to cardiac disease in this population.  The risk of [[cardiomyopathy]] is increased when trastuzumab is combined with [[anthracycline]] chemotherapy (which itself is associated with cardiac toxicity).

=== Birth control ===
Women having periods (or whose periods stopped due to chemotherapy) may need to use barrier contraception (such as [[condom]]s) while taking trastuzumab, and for at least six months afterwards. This is because of the possibility of harming a developing foetus.

===Common===
Common side effects include fever, lethargy or sleepiness, drooling, and constipation.

===Post Marketing Experience===
include other adverse reactions
*[[Urticaria]]
*[[Rash]]es

===Warnings and Precautions===
In December 2013 the FDA added warnings to the label for clobazam, that it can cause serious skin reactions, [[Stevens-Johnson syndrome]] and [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]], especially in the first 8 weeks of treatment.

===Drug interactions===
*[[Alcohol]] increases bioavailability by 50%
*[[Cimetidine]] increases the effects of clobazam
*[[Valproate]]

===Overdose===
Overdose and intoxication with benzodiazepine, including ONFI, may lead to CNS depression, associated with drowsiness, confusion and lethargy, possibly progressing to ataxia, respiratory depression, hypotension and rarely coma or death. The risk of a fatal outcome is increased in cases of combined poisoning with other CNS depressants, including alcohol.

===Abuse potential and addiction===
{{See also|Benzodiazepine drug misuse}}

Clobazam in animal studies has been shown to increase reward seeking behaviours which may suggest an increased risk of addictive behavioural patterns. Significant clobazam abuse has been reported in some countries, according to a 1983 World Health Organisation report.

===Dependence and withdrawal===
In humans tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of clobazam may occur and withdrawal seizures can occur during abrupt or overrapid withdrawal.

Clobazam as with other [[benzodiazepine]] drugs can lead to [[physical dependence]], [[Substance dependence|addiction]] and what is known as the [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]]. Withdrawal from clobazam or other benzodiazepines after regular use often leads to withdrawal symptoms which are similar to those seen during alcohol and [[barbiturate]] withdrawal. The higher the dose and the longer the drug is taken for, the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can, however, occur from standard dosages and also after short-term use{{nonspecific|date=October 2016}}. Benzodiazepine treatment should be discontinued as soon as possible via a slow and gradual dose reduction regimen.

    <title>Quinine</title>

Quinine can cause unpredictable serious and life-threatening blood and cardiovascular reactions including [[thrombocytopenia|low platelet count]] and [[hemolytic-uremic syndrome]]/[[thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura]] (HUS/TTP), [[long QT syndrome]] and other serious cardiac arrhythmias including [[torsades de pointes]], [[blackwater fever]], [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]], [[leukopenia]], and [[neutropenia]].  Some people who have developed TTP due to quinine have gone on to develop [[kidney failure]].

It can also cause serious hypersensitivity reactions include anaphylactic shock, [[urticaria]], serious skin rashes, including [[Stevens-Johnson syndrome]] and [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]], [[angioedema]], facial edema, bronchospasm, [[Idiopathic granulomatous hepatitis|granulomatous hepatitis]], and itchiness.

The most common adverse effects involve a group of symptoms called [[cinchonism]]; almost everyone taking quinine has mild cinchonism {{Citation needed|reason=Need perhaps better phrasing and sources|date=August 2017}}, which can include headache, vasodilation and sweating, nausea, tinnitus, hearing impairment, vertigo or dizziness, blurred vision, and disturbance in color perception {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}. More severe cinchonism includes vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, deafness, blindness, and disturbances in heart rhythms.  Cinchonism is much less common when quinine is given by mouth, but oral quinine is not well tolerated (quinine is exceedingly bitter and many patients will vomit after ingesting quinine tablets): Other drugs, such as Fansidar ([[sulfadoxine]] with [[pyrimethamine]]) or Malarone ([[proguanil]] with [[atovaquone]]), are often used when oral therapy is required. Quinine ethyl carbonate is tasteless and odourless, but is available commercially only in Japan. Blood glucose, electrolyte and cardiac monitoring are not necessary when quinine is given by mouth.

===Withdrawal===
Clonidine suppresses sympathetic outflow resulting in lower blood pressure, but sudden discontinuation can cause rebound hypertension due to a rebound in sympathetic outflow.

Clonidine therapy should generally be gradually tapered when discontinuing therapy to avoid [[rebound effects]] from occurring. Treatment of clonidine withdrawal hypertension depends on the severity of the condition. Reintroduction of clonidine for mild cases,  alpha and beta blockers for more urgent situations. Beta blockers never should be used alone to treat clonidine withdrawal as alpha vasoconstriction would still continue.

Because of its hormonal effects, cimetidine rarely may cause [[sexual dysfunction]] including loss of [[libido]] and [[erectile dysfunction]] and [[gynecomastia]] (0.1–0.2%) in males during long-term treatment. Rarely, [[interstitial nephritis]], [[urticaria]], and [[angioedema]] have been reported with cimetidine treatment.

[[Image:Metoclopramide ampule.jpg|thumb|Plastic [[ampoule]] of metoclopramide]]

Common [[adverse drug reaction]]s (ADRs) associated with metoclopramide therapy include restlessness ([[akathisia]]), and [[focal dystonia]]. Infrequent ADRs include [[hypertension]], [[hypotension]], [[hyperprolactinaemia]] leading to [[galactorrhea]], constipation, depression, headache, and [[Extrapyramidal symptoms|extrapyramidal effects]] such as [[oculogyric crisis]]. Rare but serious ADRs associated with metoclopramide therapy include [[agranulocytosis]], [[supraventricular tachycardia]], [[hyperaldosteronism]], [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]], [[akathisia]] and [[tardive dyskinesia]]. The risk of extrapyramidal effects is increased in people under 20 years of age, and with high-dose or prolonged therapy. Tardive dyskinesia may be persistent and irreversible in some people. The majority of reports of tardive dyskinesia occur in people who have used metoclopramide for more than three months. Consequently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that metoclopramide be used for short-term treatment, preferably less than 12 weeks. In 2009, the FDA required all manufacturers of metoclopramide to issue a [[black box warning]] regarding the risk of tardive dyskinesia with chronic or high-dose use of the drug. Agents in the [[benzodiazepine]] class of drugs may be helpful, but benefits are usually modest and side effects of sedation and weakness can be problematic.

In some cases, the [[akathisia]] effects of metoclopramide are directly related to the infusion rate when the drug is administered intravenously. Side effects were usually seen in the first 15 min after the dose of metoclopramide.

    <title>Clozapine</title>

Clozapine may cause side effects. Some are serious and potentially fatal. Common side effects include [[constipation]], bed-wetting, night-time [[drooling]], [[muscle stiffness]], [[sedation]], [[tremor]]s, [[orthostatic hypotension]], hyperglycemia, and [[weight gain]]. The risk of developing [[extrapyramidal symptoms]] such as tardive dyskinesia is below that of typical antipsychotics; this may be due to clozapine's anticholinergic effects. Extrapyramidal symptoms may subside somewhat after a person switches from another antipsychotic to clozapine.

Clozapine also carries five black box warnings, including warnings for agranulocytosis, [[central nervous system depression]], [[leukopenia]], [[neutropenia]], seizure disorder, [[bone marrow suppression]], dementia, hypotension, myocarditis, [[orthostatic hypotension]] (with or without [[syncope (medicine)|syncope]]) and seizures. Lowering of the [[seizure threshold]] may be dose related and slow initial titration of dose may decrease the risk for precipitating seizures. Slow titration of dosing may also decrease the risk for orthostatic hypotension and other adverse cardiovascular side effects.

Many male patients have experienced cessation of [[ejaculation]] during [[orgasm]] as a side effect of clozapine, though this is not documented in official drug guides.

However, many side-effects can be managed and do not necessarily warrant discontinuation.

===Agranulocytosis===
{{main|Agranulocytosis}}
Clozapine carries a black box warning for drug-induced agranulocytosis. Without monitoring, agranulocytosis occurs in about 1% of people who take clozapine during the first few months of treatment; the risk of developing it is highest about three months into treatment, and decreases substantially thereafter, to less than 0.01% after one year. Within the context of trials, the potentially dangerous white blood cell decline seems to be more frequent in children and adolescents and in the elderly than in young adults or people of middle age.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Clozapine-induced agranulocytosis can be transient.

===Cardiac toxicity===
Myocarditis is a sometimes fatal side effect of clozapine, which usually develops within the first month of commencement. First manifestations of illness are fever which may be accompanied by symptoms associated with upper respiratory tract, gastrointestinal or urinary tract infection. Typically [[C-reactive protein]] (CRP) increases with the onset of fever and rises in the cardiac enzyme, [[troponin]], occur up to 5 days later. Monitoring guidelines advise checking CRP and troponin at baseline and weekly for the first 4 weeks after clozapine initiation and observing the patient for signs and symptoms of illness. Signs of [[heart failure]] are less common and may develop with the rise in troponin. A recent case-control study found that the risk of clozapine-induced myocarditis is increased with increasing rate of clozapine dose titration, increasing age and concomitant sodium valproate.

===Gastrointestinal hypomotility===
Another underrecognized and potentially life-threatening side effect spectrum is gastrointestinal hypomotility, which may manifest as severe [[constipation]], [[fecal impaction]], paralytic [[ileus]], [[bowel obstruction]], acute megacolon, [[ischemia]] or [[necrosis]]. Colonic hypomotility has been shown to occur in up to 80% of people prescribed clozapine when [[gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] function is measured objectively using [[radiopaque]] markers. Clozapine-induced gastrointestinal hypomotility currently has a higher mortality rate than the better known side effect of agranulocytosis. A [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane review]] found little evidence to help guide decisions about the best treatment for gastrointestinal hypomotility caused by clozapine and other [[antipsychotic]] medication. Monitoring bowel function and the preemptive use of [[laxative]]s for all clozapine-treated people has been shown to improve colonic transit times and reduce serious sequelae.

===Hypersalivation===
While clozapine is a [[muscarinic]] antagonist at the [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1|M1]], [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2|M2]], [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3|M3]], and [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M5|M5]] receptors, clozapine is a full agonist at the [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M4|M4]] subset. Because M4 is highly expressed in the [[salivary gland]], its M4 agonist activity is thought to be responsible for the hypersalivation.

===Central nervous system===
CNS side effects include [[drowsiness]], [[vertigo]], [[headache]], [[tremor]], [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]], [[sleep disturbances]], [[nightmares]], restlessness, [[akinesia]], [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]], [[seizures]], [[rigidity (neurology)|rigidity]], [[akathisia]], [[confusion]], [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[insomnia]], [[hyperkinesia]], [[weakness]], [[lethargy]], [[ataxia]], [[slurred speech]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[myoclonic jerks]], and [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]]. Rarely seen are [[delusions]], [[hallucinations]], [[delirium]], [[amnesia]], [[libido]] increase or decrease, [[paranoia]] and [[irritability]], [[Electroencephalography#Abnormal activity|abnormal EEG]], worsening of [[psychosis]], [[paresthesia]], [[status epilepticus]], and [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|obsessive compulsive symptoms]]. Similar to other [[antipsychotics]] clozapine rarely has been known to cause [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]].

===Urinary incontinence===
Clozapine is linked to [[urinary incontinence]], though its appearance may be under-recognized.

===Withdrawal effects===
Abrupt withdrawal may lead to [[cholinergic]] [[rebound effects]], severe movement disorders as well as severe psychotic decompensation. It has been recommended that patients, families, and caregivers are aware of the symptoms and risks of abrupt withdrawal of clozapine. When discontinuing clozapine, gradual dose reduction is recommended to reduce the intensity of withdrawal effects.

===Weight gain and diabetes===
In addition to [[hyperglycemia]], significant [[weight gain]] is frequently experienced by patients treated with clozapine. [[Impaired glucose metabolism]] and [[obesity]] have been shown to be constituents of the [[metabolic syndrome]] and may increase the risk of [[cardiovascular disease]]. The data suggest that clozapine may be more likely to cause adverse metabolic effects than some of the other [[atypical antipsychotics]]. A study has established that [[olanzapine]] and clozapine disturb the [[metabolism]] by making the body take preferentially its energy from [[fat]] (instead of privileging carbohydrates). Levels of [[carbohydrates]] remaining high, the body develops [[insulin resistance]] (causing [[diabetes]]).

Artesunate is generally safe and well-tolerated. The best recognised side effect of the artemesinins is that they lower [[reticulocyte]] counts. This is not usually of clinical relevance.

With increased use of I.V. artesunate, there have been reports of post-artesunate delayed [[Hemolysis|haemolysis]] (PADH). Delayed haemolysis (occurring around two weeks after treatment) has been observed in patients treated with artesunate for severe malaria. It is unclear whether or not this haemolysis is due to artesunate or to the malaria itself.

Tolcapone has demonstrated significant [[liver toxicity]] (hepatotoxicity) Treatment with tolcapone runs the risk of eliciting or prolonging [[dyskinesia]]; this can be counteracted by decreasing the dose of levodopa. This occurs because the administration of tolcapone results in the accumulation of the biological methyl donor [[S-Adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl-&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-methionine]] (SAM) in the [[striatum]] that induces Parkinson symptoms.

Digestive symptoms include [[nausea]] and [[diarrhea]]; further dopaminergic side effects include [[orthostatic hypotension]], dry mouth, sweating and dizziness.  Tolcapone causes more severe diarrhea than entacapone; this was the most common reason for therapy termination in studies. Urine discoloration comes from yellow tolcapone [[metabolite]]s being excreted in the urine and is harmless.

    <title>Zafirlukast</title>

Zafirlukast is generally well-tolerated, though headache and gastrointestinal (GI) upset can occur. The incidence of headache is between 12 and 20%, which is similar to the incidence of headache found in patients taking [[placebos]] in the studies that lead to zafirlukast's approval. GI upset may include nausea, stomach discomfort/pain, and diarrhea. GI complaints can be lessened by taking zafirlukast with food, though this can dramatically impair the amount of drug that gets absorbed into the body (see the section on [[Zafirlukast#Drug-food interactions|drug-food interactions]] below).

===Neuropsychiatric effects===
Neuropsychiatric side effects have been reported with the use of zafirlukast and other LTRAs. While some side effects are less severe (e.g. abnormal dreams), others are more serious (e.g. hallucinations, tremor, suicidality). These effects were discovered through post-marketing reports, as the initial trials were not designed to monitor for neuropsychiatric side effects. Zafirlukast-induced hepatotoxicity is characterized by a spectrum of liver damage symptoms, including fatigue, nausea, and right upper quadrant pain followed by dark urine, jaundice and pruritus. Liver enzyme elevations are common, and the pattern usually reflects hepatocellular damage, resembling acute viral hepatitis. It is unclear how the hepatotoxicity occurs, but it may be due to a metabolic intermediate of zafirlukast, since it is metabolized in the liver through the enzyme [[CYP2C9]]. When it does occur it can be fatal, and reexposure with zafirlukast may result in a worse injury. Switching zafirlukast to another medication in the same class (e.g. [[montelukast]]) or in the related class of [[5-lipoxygenase inhibitors]] can be attempted, but caution should be employed.

According to the &quot;Dear Health Care Provider&quot; letter from AstraZeneca, zafirlukast-induced hepatotoxicity has occurred predominantly in females. While the exact etiology of the development of Churg-Strauss symptoms in proximity to initiating zafirlukast is unknown, it is thought that withdrawal of chronic corticosteroids &quot;unmasks&quot; the previously undetected disease. Because corticosteroid withdrawal often happens while starting a new anti-asthma medication (like zafirlukast), this explains the rare but notable association. These cases may represent misdiagnosed asthma, as Churg-Strauss syndrome can induce symptoms of airway obstruction that are akin to an acute asthma exacerbation. As these asthma-like symptoms are reduced by zafirlukast, the symptoms of Churg-Strauss (e.g. neuropathy) increase due to the lack of the broader, anti-inflammatory coverage that the steroid was providing.

    <title>Pioglitazone</title>

A press release by GlaxoSmithKline in February 2007 noted that there is a greater incidence of fractures of the upper arms, hands and feet in female diabetics given [[rosiglitazone]] compared with those given metformin or glyburide. The information was based on data from the ADOPT trial. Following release of this statement, [[Takeda Pharmaceutical Company]], the developer of pioglitazone (sold as Actos in many markets) admitted that it has similar implications for female patients.

The risk of [[hypoglycemia]] is low in the absence of other drugs that lower blood glucose.

Pioglitazone can cause [[water retention (medicine)|fluid retention]] and peripheral [[edema]]. As a result, it may precipitate [[Heart failure|congestive heart failure]] (which worsens with fluid overload in those at risk). It may cause [[anemia]]. Mild weight gain is common due to increase in subcutaneous [[adipose tissue]]. In studies, patients on pioglitazone had an increased proportion of upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, headache, myalgia and tooth problems.

Chronic administration of the drug has led to occasional instances of [[cholestatic hepatitis]], reversible upon drug discontinuation.

On July 30, 2007 an Advisory Committee of the Food and Drug Administration concluded that the use of rosiglitazone for the treatment of type 2 diabetes was associated with a greater risk of &quot;myocardial ischemic events&quot; when compared to placebo, but when compared to other diabetes drugs, there was no increased risk. Pioglitazone is currently being reviewed. A [[meta-analysis]] released subsequently showed that pioglitazone reduced the risk of ischemic cardiac events rather than increased the risk, but increased [[Heart failure|CHF]].

===Bladder cancer===
On June 9, 2011 the [[French Agency for the Safety of Health Products]] decided to withdraw pioglitazone in regards to high risk of [[bladder cancer]]. This suspension was based on the results of an epidemiological study conducted by the French National Health Insurance. According to the results of the epidemiological study, the French agency found that patients, who were taking Actos for a long time to aid in type 2 diabetes mellitus, significantly increased risk of bladder cancer compared with patients who were taking other diabetes medications. On June 10, 2011 Germany's [[Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices]] also advised doctors not to prescribe the medication until further investigation of the cancer risk had been conducted.

On June 15, 2011 the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] announced that pioglitazone use for more than one year may be associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer, and two months later the label was updated with an additional warning about this risk.

    <title>Olanzapine</title>

{{See also|List of adverse effects of olanzapine}}

The principal side effect of olanzapine is weight gain, which may be profound in some cases and/or associated with derangement in the blood lipid and blood sugar profiles (see section [[Olanzapine#Metabolic effects|metabolic effects]]). A recent meta-analysis of the efficacy and tolerance of 15 antipsychotic drugs (APDs) found that it had the highest propensity for causing weight gain out of the 15 APD compared with a SMD of 0.74 Extrapyramidal side effects, although potentially serious, are infrequent to rare from olanzapine

Despite weight gain, a large multi-center randomized [[National Institute of Mental Health]] study found that olanzapine was better at controlling symptoms because patients were more likely to remain on olanzapine than the other drugs. One small, open-label, non-randomized study suggests that taking olanzapine by orally dissolving tablets may induce less weight gain, but this has not been substantiated in a blinded experimental setting.

===Pregnancy and lactation===
Olanzapine is associated with the highest placental exposure of any atypical antipsychotic. Olanzapine is associated with weight gain which according to recent studies may put olanzapine-treated patients' offspring at a heightened risk for [[neural tube defects]] (e.g. [[spina bifida]]). Breastfeeding in women taking olanzapine is advised against due to the fact that olanzapine is secreted in breast milk with one study finding that the exposure to the infant (in mg per kg of body weight, that is) is about 1.8% that to the mother.

===Animal toxicology===
Olanzapine has demonstrated carcinogenic effects in multiple studies when exposed chronically to female mice and rats, but not male mice and rats.  The tumors found were in either the liver or mammary glands of the animals.
Olanzapine is considered moderately toxic in overdose, more toxic than quetiapine, aripiprazole, and the [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors|SSRIs]] and less toxic than the [[monoamine oxidase inhibitors|MAOIs]] and [[tricyclic antidepressants|TCAs]].

[[Image:pentazocine.jpg|frame|right]]
Side effects are similar to those of [[morphine]], but pentazocine, due to its action at the kappa opioid receptor is more likely to invoke [[psychotomimetic]] effects. High dose may cause [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] or [[tachycardia|high heart rate]]. [[Respiratory depression]] is a common side effect, but is subject to a ceiling effect, such that at a certain dose the degree of respiratory depression will no longer increase with dose increases. Likewise rarely it has been associated with [[agranulocytosis]], [[erythema multiforme]] and [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]].

===Tissue damage at injection sites===
Severe injection site necrosis and sepsis has occurred (sometime requiring amputation of limb) with multiple injection of pentazocine lactate. In addition, animal studies have demonstrated that Pentazocine is tolerated less well subcutaneously than intramuscularly.

As little of the medication crosses the blood brain barrier it has less effects on the [[central nervous system|brain]] and therefore has reduced occurrence of the centrally-mediated effects (such as [[delusions]], [[somnolence]], and inhibition of motor-functions) which hinder the usefulness of some other anticholinergic drugs. Hyoscine butylbromide is still capable of impacting the [[chemoreceptor trigger zone]] due to the lack of a well-developed blood-brain-barrier in the [[medulla oblongata]], which potentiates the [[antiemetic]] effects that it produces via local action on the [[smooth muscle]] of the [[gastrointestinal tract]].

    <title>Hydrochlorothiazide</title>

* [[Hypokalemia]], or low blood levels of potassium are an occasional side effect. It can be usually prevented by [[potassium]] supplements or by combining hydrochlorothiazide with a [[potassium-sparing diuretic]]
* Other disturbances in the levels of serum electrolytes including [[hypomagnesemia]] (low magnesium), [[hyponatremia]] (low sodium), and [[hypercalcemia]] (high calcium)
* [[Hyperuricemia]], high levels of uric acid in the blood

These side effects increase with the dose of the medication and are most common at doses of greater than 25&amp;nbsp;mg per day.

Package inserts, based on case reports and observational studies, have reported that an allergy to a [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfa drug]] predisposes the patient to cross sensitivity to a thiazide diuretic. A 2005 review of the literature did not find support for this cross-sensitivity.

The medication has two FDA &quot;black box&quot; warnings: One raises concerns that use before or during pregnancy by either sex may result in birth defects in the baby, and the other is regarding the risk of red blood cell breakdown.

Ribavirin should not be given with [[zidovudine]] because of the increased risk of anemia; concurrent use with [[didanosine]] should likewise be avoided because of an increased risk of [[mitochondrial toxicity]].

Common adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with pseudoephedrine therapy include [[central nervous system]] stimulation, insomnia, nervousness, excitability, dizziness and anxiety. Infrequent ADRs include [[tachycardia]] or [[palpitation]]s. Rarely, pseudoephedrine therapy may be associated with [[mydriasis]] (dilated pupils), [[hallucination]]s, [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]]s, [[hypertension]], seizures and [[ischemic colitis]]; The safety and effectiveness of nasal decongestant use in children is unclear.

The antihypertensive effects of [[methyldopa]], [[mecamylamine]], [[reserpine]] and [[veratrum alkaloids]] may be reduced by sympathomimetics. [[Beta-adrenergic antagonist]]s may also interact with sympathomimetics. Increase of ectopic pacemaker activity can occur when pseudoephedrine is used concomitantly with [[digitalis]]. [[Antacids]] increase the rate of pseudoephedrine absorption, while [[kaolin]] decreases it.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

{{See also|List of adverse effects of risperidone}}

===Drug interactions===

* [[Carbamazepine]] and other [[enzyme inducer]]s may reduce plasma levels of risperidone.
* [[CYP2D6]] inhibitors, such as [[SSRI]] medications, may increase plasma levels of risperidone.
* Since risperidone can cause [[hypotension]], its use should be monitored closely when a patient is also taking [[Antihypertensive drug|anti-hypertensive medicines]] to avoid severe low blood pressure.

===Discontinuation===
The [[British National Formulary]] recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotic treatment to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse.  Some have argued the additional somatic and psychiatric symptoms associated with dopaminergic super-sensitivity, including dyskinesia and acute psychosis, are common features of withdrawal in individuals treated with neuroleptics. This has led some to suggest the withdrawal process might itself be schizomimetic, producing schizophrenia-like symptoms even in previously healthy patients, indicating a possible pharmacological origin of [[mental illness]] in a yet unknown percentage of patients currently and previously treated with antipsychotics.  This question is unresolved, and remains a highly controversial issue among professionals in the medical and mental health communities, as well the public.

===Dementia===
Older people with dementia-related psychosis are at a higher risk of death if they take risperidone compared to those who do not. Most deaths are related to heart problems or infections.

 effects are mainly gastrointestinal or dermatological. Gastrointestinal adverse effects were observed in 2.4% of patients during clinical trials and included: diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and elevated transaminases. Allergic symptoms were observed in
    <title>Ethionamide</title>


Ethionamide frequently causes gastrointestinal distress with nausea and vomiting which can lead patients to stop taking it. This can sometimes be improved by taking it with food.

Ethionamide can cause [[Hepatocyte|hepatocellular]] toxicity and is contraindicated in patients with severe [[Liver disease|liver impairment]]. Patients on ethionamide should have regular monitoring of their [[liver function tests]]. Liver toxicity occurs in up to 5% of patients and follows a pattern similar to [[isoniazid]], usually arising in the first 1 to 3 months of therapy, but can occur even after more than 6 months of therapy.

Both central neurological side effects such as psychiatric disturbances and [[encephalopathy]], along with [[peripheral neuropathy]] have been reported. Administering [[pyridoxine]] along with ethionamide may reduce these effects and is recommended.

Ethionamide is structurally similar to [[methimazole]], which is used to inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis, and has been linked to [[hypothyroidism]] in several TB patients. Periodic monitoring of [[Thyroid function tests|thyroid function]] while on ethionamide is recommended.

===Interactions===
Ethionamide may worsen the adverse effects of other antituberculous drugs being taken at the same time. It boosts levels of isoniazid when taken together and can lead to increased rates of peripheral neuropathy and hepatotoxicity. When taken with [[cycloserine]], [[Epileptic seizure|seizures]] have been reported. High rates of hepatotoxicty have been reported when taken with [[rifampicin]]. The drug's labeling cautions against excessive alcohol ingestion as it may provoke a psychotic reaction.

Common [[side effect]]s of pramipexole may include:

* [[Headache]]
*[[Peripheral edema]] (Tan EK, Ondo W. Clinical characteristics of pramipexole-induced peripheral edema. Arch Neurol. 2000;57:729-732.)
* [[Hyperalgesia]] (body aches and pains)
* [[Nausea]] and [[vomiting]]
* [[Sedation]] and [[somnolence]]
* Decreased [[appetite]] and subsequent [[weight loss]]
* [[Orthostatic hypotension]] (resulting in [[dizziness]], [[lightheadedness]], and possibly [[fainting]], especially when standing up)
* [[Insomnia]]
* [[Hallucination]]s (seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting or feeling things that are not there)
* Twitching, twisting, or other [[Movement disorder|unusual body movements]]
* Unusual tiredness or weakness

Several unusual adverse effects of pramipexole (and related D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-preferring dopamine agonist medications such as [[ropinirole]]) may include [[compulsive gambling]], [[punding]],  [[hypersexuality]], and [[overeating]], even in patients without any prior history of these behaviours.

    <title>Abacavir</title>

Common adverse reactions include nausea, headache, fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite and trouble sleeping. Rare but serious side effects include hypersensitivity reaction or rash, elevated AST and ALT, depression, anxiety, fever/chills, URI, lactic acidosis, hypertriglyceridemia, and lipodystrophy.

People with liver disease should be cautious about using abacavir because it can aggravate the condition. Signs of liver problems include nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, dark-colored urine and yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes. The use of [[nucleoside]] drugs such as abacavir can very rarely cause [[lactic acidosis]]. Signs of lactic acidosis include fast or irregular heartbeat, unusual muscle pain, fatigue, difficulty breathing and stomach pain with nausea and vomiting. Abacavir can also lead to immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, a change in body fat as well as an increased risk of heart attack.

Resistance to abacavir has developed in laboratory versions of HIV which are also resistant to other HIV-specific antiretrovirals such as [[lamivudine]], [[didanosine]] and [[zalcitabine]]. HIV strains that are resistant to [[protease inhibitors]] are not likely to be resistant to abacavir.

Abacavir is contraindicated for use in infants under 3 months of age.

Little is known about the effects of Abacavir overdose. Overdose victims should be taken to a hospital emergency room for treatment.

===Hypersensitivity syndrome===
[[Hypersensitivity]] to abacavir is strongly associated with a specific allele at the [[human leukocyte antigen]] B [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] namely [[HLA-B57|HLA-B*5701]]. There is an association between the prevalence of HLA-B*5701 and ancestry. The prevalence of the [[allele]] is estimated to be 3.4 to 5.8 percent on average in populations of European ancestry, 17.6 percent in [[Indian American]]s, 3.0 percent in Hispanic Americans, and 1.2 percent in [[Chinese American]]s.  There is significant variability in the prevalence of HLA-B*5701 among African populations. In [[African American]]s, the prevalence is estimated to be 1.0 percent on average, 0 percent in the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] from [[Nigeria]], 3.3 percent in the [[Luhya people|Luhya]] from [[Kenya]], and 13.6 percent in the [[Masai people|Masai]] from Kenya, although the average values are derived from highly variable frequencies within sample groups.

Common symptoms of abacavir hypersensitivity syndrome include [[fever]], [[malaise]], [[nausea]], and [[diarrhea]]. Some patients may also develop a [[Rash|skin rash]]. Symptoms of AHS typically manifest within six weeks of treatment using abacavir, although they may be confused with symptoms of [[HIV]], immune restoration disease, hypersensitivity syndromes associated with other drugs, or infection. The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) released an alert concerning abacavir and abacavir-containing medications on July 24, 2008, and the FDA-approved drug label for abacavir recommends pre-therapy screening for the HLA-B*5701 allele and the use of alternative therapy in subjects with this allele. Additionally, both the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium and the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group recommend use of an alternative therapy in individuals with the HLA-B*5701 allele.

[[File:Epikutanni-test.jpg|thumb|[[Patch test]]]]

[[Patch test|Skin-patch testing]] may also be used to determine whether an individual will experience a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, although some patients susceptible to developing AHS may not react to the patch test.

The development of suspected hypersensitivity reactions to abacavir requires immediate and permanent discontinuation of abacavir therapy in all patients, including patients who do not possess the HLA-B*5701 allele. On March 1, 2011, the FDA informed the public about an ongoing safety review of abacavir and a possible increased risk of heart attack associated with the drug. A [[meta-analysis]] of 26 studies conducted by the FDA, however, did not find any association between abacavir use and heart attack 

===Immunopathogenesis===
The mechanism underlying abacavir hypersensitivity syndrome is related to the change in the HLA-B*5701 [[protein]] product. Abacavir binds with high specificity to the HLA-B*5701 protein, changing the shape and chemistry of the antigen-binding cleft. This results in a change in [[Immune tolerance|immunological tolerance]] and the subsequent activation of abacavir-specific [[cytotoxic T cell]]s, which produce a systemic reaction known as abacavir hypersensitivity syndrome.

According to documentation distributed by [[Teva Pharmaceuticals]], one-third of participants in clinical trials reported experiencing headaches; 11% reported nausea; other negative side-effects such as nervousness, diarrhea, insomnia, anxiety, dizziness, and gastrointestinal problems were reported by fewer than 10% of participants.

Rare occurrences have been reported of more serious adverse effects, including severe skin rashes and other symptoms that are probably allergy-related. From the date of initial marketing, December 1998, to January 30, 2007, the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] received six cases of severe cutaneous adverse reactions associated with modafinil, including [[erythema multiforme]] (EM), [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]] (SJS), [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]] (TEN), and [[DRESS syndrome]], involving adult and pediatric patients. The FDA issued a relevant alert. In the same alert, the FDA also noted that [[angioedema]] and multi-organ hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported in postmarketing experiences. In 2007, the FDA ordered Cephalon to modify the Provigil leaflet in bold-face print of several serious and potentially fatal conditions attributed to modafinil use, including TEN, DRESS syndrome, and SJS.

The long term safety and effectiveness of modafinil have not been determined.

Modafinil may have an adverse effect on [[Hormonal contraception|hormonal contraceptives]] for up to a month after discontinuation.

===Addiction and dependence potential===
The [[addiction]] and [[drug dependence|dependence]] liabilities of modafinil are very low. It shares biochemical mechanisms with addictive [[stimulant]] drugs, and some studies have reported it to have similar mood-elevating properties, although to a lesser degree. Monkeys will self-administer modafinil if they have previously been trained to self-administer cocaine. Reported [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal symptoms]] include [[anhedonia]], [[lethargy]], anxiety, and insomnia.

===Tolerance===
Large-scale clinical studies have found no evidence of tolerance with modafinil at therapeutic dosages even with prolonged use (for 40 weeks and as long as three years).

===Psychiatric reactions===
Modafinil-associated psychiatric reactions have occurred in those with and without a pre-existing psychiatric history.

Pregabalin has been shown to produce [[therapeutic effect]]s that are similar to other [[controlled substances]]. In a study with recreational users of [[sedative]] and [[hypnotic]] drugs, a 450&amp;nbsp;mg dose of pregabalin resulted in subjective ratings of a &quot;good drug effect&quot; and &quot;high&quot; and &quot;liking&quot; similar to 30&amp;nbsp;mg of [[diazepam]]. In clinical studies, pregabalin showed a [[side effect]] profile similar to other [[central nervous system depressants]].

[[Adverse drug reaction]]s associated with the use of pregabalin include:
Even people who have discontinued short term and or long term use of pregabalin have experienced [[withdrawal symptoms]], including [[insomnia]], headache, [[nausea]], [[anxiety]], diarrhea, [[flu like symptoms]], nervousness, [[major depression]], pain, [[convulsion]]s, [[hyperhidrosis]] and dizziness.

Compared to other {{abbr|TCAs|tricyclic antidepressants}} it produces significantly fewer cardiovascular, [[anticholinergic]] (like dry mouth or constipation), [[sedative]] and appetite-stimulating effects. A recent review found that it was amongst the antidepressants most prone to causing hepatotoxicity (liver damage), although the evidence to support this concern was of limited quality. Although not well studied with tianeptine, it has been shown for tricyclic antidepressants that they may cause [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s.

[[File:000040lg Azathioprine 50 MG Oral Tablet.jpg|thumb|260px|left|Two generic azathioprine oral tablets, 50 mg each]]
Nausea and vomiting are common adverse effects, especially at the beginning of a treatment. Such cases are met with taking azathioprine after meals or transient [[intravenous]] administration. Side effects that are probably [[hypersensitivity]] reactions include dizziness, diarrhea, [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], and [[skin rashes]]. Hair loss is often seen in transplant patients receiving the drug, but rarely occurs under other indications. Because azathioprine [[bone marrow suppression|suppresses the bone marrow]], patients can develop [[anaemia]] and will be more susceptible to [[infection]]; regular monitoring of the [[blood count]] is recommended during treatment.

===Pharmacogenetics===

The enzyme [[thiopurine S-methyltransferase]] (TPMT) is responsible for various activation and deactivation steps in azathioprine's mechanism of action. The first metabolic step that azathioprine undergoes in the body is the conversion to [[mercaptopurine|6-mercaptopurine]] (6-MP; see [[#Pharmacokinetics|Pharmacokinetics]]), which is itself an [[Immunosuppressive drug|immunosuppressant]] [[prodrug]]. The FDA-approved drug label for azathioprine recommends testing for TPMT activity to identify patients at risk for [[myelotoxicity]]. Indeed, testing for TPMT activity is currently one of the few examples of [[pharmacogenetics]] being translated into routine clinical care. Missense SNP in NUDT15 (e.g., rs116855232, inducing R139C)) has been identified to be a causal factor for AZA-induced leukopenia through a genome wide association study (GWAS) in East Asians.

===Cancers===
Azathioprine is listed as a human [[carcinogen]] in the 12th Report on Carcinogens by the [[National Toxicology Program]] of [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], asserting that it is &quot;known to be a human carcinogen based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in humans.&quot; Since August 2009, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] has required warnings to be placed on packaging with respect to increased risks of certain cancers.

The risks involved seem to be related both to the duration and to the dosage used. People who have previously been treated with an [[alkylating antineoplastic agent|alkylating agent]] may have an excessive risk of cancers if treated with azathioprine. Epidemiological studies by [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC) have provided &quot;sufficient&quot; evidence of azathioprine carcinogenicity in humans ([[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|Group 1]]), although the methodology of past studies and the possible underlying mechanisms are questioned.

The various diseases requiring transplantation may in themselves increase the risks of [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]], [[squamous cell carcinoma]]s of the skin, [[Cholangiocarcinoma|hepatobiliary carcinomas]], and [[Mesenchyme|mesenchymal tumours]] to which azathioprine may add additional risks. Those receiving azathioprine for rheumatoid arthritis may have a lower risk than those undergoing transplantation.

Cases of [[hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma]] – a rare type of [[lymphoma]] – have been reported in patients treated with azathioprine. The majority occurred in patients with [[inflammatory bowel disease]]. Adolescents and young adult males were the majority of cases. They presented with a very aggressive disease course and, with one exception, died of the lymphoma. The FDA has required changes to the labeling to inform users and clinicians of the issue.

====Skin cancers====
In transplant patients, [[skin cancer]] is 50 to 250 times more common than in the general population, and between 60% and 90% of patients are affected 20 years after transplantation. The use of immunosuppressive medication including azathioprine in organ transplantation has been linked to increased rates of developing skin cancer. Azathioprine causes the accumulation of [[6-thioguanine]] (6-TG) in patients' DNA, which might trigger cancer when the patient is later exposed to [[ultraviolet light]]. Patients taking azathioprine were found to be abnormally sensitive to UVA light.

    <title>Alfaxalone</title>

Alfaxalone has relatively few side effects compared to other anesthetics; most notable is its lack of [[cardiovascular]] depression at clinical doses, which makes it unique among anesthetics. The most common side effect is respiratory depression: in addition to [[apnea]], the most prevalent, alfaxalone can also decrease the [[respiratory rate]], [[minute volume]], and [[oxygen saturation]] in the blood in cats and dogs. Alfaxalone should be administered slowly over a period of at least 60 seconds or until anesthesia is induced; as quick administration increases the risk of apnea. Alfaxalone has some depressive effects on the [[central nervous system]], including a reduction in [[Cerebral circulation|cerebral flood flow]] and [[intracranial pressure]], as well as in [[Thermoregulation|body temperature]].

[[Greyhound]]s, who are particularly susceptible to anesthetic side effects, can have decreased blood flow and oxygen supply to the [[liver]].

When no premedications are used, alfaxalone causes animals (especially cats) to be agitated when recovering. Dogs and cats will paddle in the air, vocalize excessively, may remain rigid or twitch, and have exaggerated reactions to external stimuli such as light and noise. For this reason, it is recommended that animals recovering from anesthesia by alfaxalone stay in a quiet, dark area.

===Overdose===
The quick metabolism and elimination of alfaxalone from the body decreases the chance of overdose. It would takes over 28 times the normal dose to cause toxicity in cats. Such doses, however, can cause [[low blood pressure]], apnea, [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], arrhythmia (caused by the apnea and hypoxia).

* Patients treated with drugs compromising bone marrow function (e.g. [[cytostatic]]s) should be treated carefully. [[Blood cell count]]s should be taken very frequently.
* Patients with renal disease should receive flucytosine cautiously and in reduced doses. Guidelines for proper dosing exist. Serum level determinations are mandatory for these patients.
* All patients receiving flucytosine should be under strict medical supervision.
* [[Hematological]], [[renal]] and liver function studies should be done frequently during therapy (initially daily, twice a week for the rest of treatment).
* Patients with preexisting bone marrow depression and liver impairment should be treated with caution. 
* Antiproliferative actions on bone marrow and GI tissue: Due to the drug's preference for rapidly proliferating tissues, bone marrow depression ([[anemia]], [[leukopenia]], [[pancytopenia]], or even rarely [[agranulocytosis]]) may occur. [[Aplastic anemia]] has also been seen. Bone marrow toxicity can be irreversible and may cause death, particularly in immunocompromised patients. GI toxicity may be severe or rarely fatal and consists of anorexia, abdominal bloating, [[abdominal pain]], [[diarrhea]], dry mouth, [[duodenal ulcer]], GI hemorrhage, nausea, vomiting, and [[ulcerative colitis]].
* Liver function: Elevations of [[liver enzymes]] and [[bilirubin]], hepatic dysfunction, [[jaundice]] and, in one patient, liver necrosis have all been seen. Some fatal cases have been reported; however, the majority of cases was reversible.
* Renal function: Increased [[Blood urea nitrogen|BUN]] and serum [[creatinine]] have been noted. [[Crystalluria]] (formation of crystals and excretion in the urine) and acute renal failure have also been seen.
* Adverse [[central nervous system]] effects are frequent and include confusion, [[hallucination]]s, [[psychosis]], [[ataxia]], [[hearing loss]], headache, [[paresthesia]], [[parkinsonism]], [[peripheral neuropathy]], vertigo and sedation.
* Skin reactions: Rash, pruritus, and [[photosensitivity]] have all been noticed. Toxic epidermal necrolysis ([[Lyell's syndrome]]) may also be encountered and may be life-threatening.
* [[Anaphylaxis]]: Sometimes cases of anaphylaxis consisting of diffuse erythema, pruritus, conjunctival injection, fever, abdominal pain, edema, hypotension and bronchospastic reactions are observed.

It is not known if flucytosine is a human [[carcinogen]]. The issue has been raised because traces of [[5-fluorouracil]], which is a known carcinogen, are found in the colon resulting from the metabolization of flucytosine.

Commonly reported adverse effects associated with the use of oxacillin include skin rash, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, hematuria, agranulocytosis, eosinophilia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, hepatotoxicity, acute interstitial nephritis, and fever. High doses of oxacillin have been reported to cause renal, hepatic, and nervous system toxicity. Common to all members of the penicillin class of drugs, oxacillin may cause acute or delayed hypersensitivity reactions. As an injection, oxacillin may cause injection site reactions, which may be characterized by redness, swelling, and itching.

People have experienced serious infections due to abatacept's suppression of the immune system; some of these infections have been fatal.  People with [[COPD]] are likely to get lung infections more often than usual. Some people have had [[anaphylactic]] reactions to the drug. Abatacept may cause otherwise slow-growing [[cancers]] to proliferate and [[metastasis|spread]], due to suppression of the immune system.

Very common adverse effects (occurring in more than 10% of people) include upper respiratory tract infections. Common adverse effects (occurring in between 1% and 10% of people) include lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, herpes infections, pneumonia, flu, cough, high blood pressure, stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, upset stomach, mouth sores, [[elevated transaminases]], rashes, fatigue, weakness, local injection site reactions, and systemic injection reactions.

[[File:Pyridiumurine.jpg|thumb|The characteristic orange-colored urine after taking Pyridium]]
Phenazopyridine produces a vivid color change in urine, typically to a dark orange to reddish color. This effect is common and harmless, and indeed a key indicator of the presence of the medication in the body. Users of phenazopyridine are warned not to wear contact lenses, as phenazopyridine has been known to permanently discolor contact lenses and fabrics. Other such side effects include [[fever]], [[confusion]], [[shortness of breath]], [[skin]] [[rash]], and [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] of the face, fingers, feet, or legs. Long-term use may cause yellowing of nails.

Phenazopyridine should be avoided by people with [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]], because it can cause [[hemolysis]] (destruction of [[red blood cell]]s) due to [[oxidative stress]].


Phenazopyridine is an [[azo dye]].

    <title>Cyclophosphamide</title>

[[Adverse drug reaction]]s from cyclophosphamide are related to the cumulative medication dose and include [[chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting]], [[bone marrow suppression]], [[abdominal pain|stomach ache]], [[hemorrhagic cystitis]], [[diarrhea]], darkening of the skin/nails, [[alopecia]] (hair loss) or thinning of hair, changes in color and texture of the hair and [[lethargy]]. Other side effects may include easy bruising/bleeding, joint pain, mouth sores, slow-healing existing wounds, unusual decrease in the amount of urine or unusual tiredness or weakness.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Pulmonary injury appears rare, but can present with two clinical patterns: an early, acute [[pneumonitis]] and a chronic, progressive [[pulmonary fibrosis|fibrosis]]. [[Cardiotoxicity]] is a major problem with people treated with higher dose regimens.

High-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide can cause the [[syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion]] (SIADH) and a potentially fatal [[hyponatremia]] when compounded by intravenous fluids administered to prevent drug-induced cystitis. While SIADH has been described primarily with higher doses of cyclophosphamide, it can also occur with the lower doses used in the management of inflammatory disorders.

===Bladder bleeding===
[[Acrolein]] is toxic to the [[urinary bladder|bladder]] [[epithelium]] and can lead to [[hemorrhagic cystitis]], which is associated with microscopic or gross [[hematuria]] and occasionally [[dysuria]]. Risks of hemorrhagic cystitis can be minimized with adequate fluid intake, avoidance of nighttime dosage and [[mesna]] (sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate), a sulfhydryl donor which binds and detoxifies acrolein. Intermittent dosing of cyclophosphamide decreases cumulative drug dose, reduces bladder exposure to acrolein and has equal efficacy to daily treatment in the management of [[lupus nephritis]].

===Infection===
[[Neutropenia]] or [[lymphoma]] arising secondary to cyclophosphamide usage can predispose people to a variety of [[pathogenic bacteria|bacterial]], [[mycosis|fungal]] and [[opportunistic infection]]s. No published guidelines cover [[Pneumocystis pneumonia|PCP]] prophylaxis for people with [[rheumatism|rheumatological diseases]] receiving [[immunosuppressive drugs]], but some advocate its use when receiving high-dose medication.

===Infertility===
Cyclophosphamide has been found to significantly increase the risk of [[premature ovarian failure|premature menopause]] in females and of [[infertility]] in males and females, the likelihood of which increases with cumulative drug dose and increasing patient age. Such infertility is usually temporary, but can be permanent. The use of [[leuprolide]] in women of reproductive age before administration of intermittently dosed cyclophosphamide may diminish the risks of premature menopause and infertility.

===Cancer===
Cyclophosphamide is [[carcinogen]]ic and may increase the risk of developing [[lymphoma]]s, [[leukemia]], [[skin cancer]], [[transitional cell carcinoma]] of the bladder or other malignancies. [[Myeloproliferative neoplasms]], including [[acute leukemia]], [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]] and [[multiple myeloma]], occurred in 5 of 119 [[rheumatoid arthritis]] patients within the first decade after receiving cyclophosphamide, compared with one case of [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]] in 119 rheumatoid arthritis patients with no history. Secondary [[acute myeloid leukemia]] (therapy-related AML, or &quot;t-AML&quot;) is thought to occur either by cyclophosphamide-inducing mutations or selecting for a high-risk myeloid clone.

This risk may be dependent on dose and other factors, including the condition, other agents or treatment modalities (including [[radiation therapy|radiotherapy]]), treatment length and intensity. For some regimens, it is rare. For instance, CMF-therapy for [[breast cancer]] (where the cumulative dose is typically less than 20&amp;nbsp;grams of cyclophosphamide) carries an AML risk of less than 1/2000, with some studies finding no increased risk compared to background. Other treatment regimens involving higher doses may carry risks of 1–2% or higher. Cyclophosphamide-induced AML, when it happens, typically presents some years after treatment, with incidence peaking around 3–9 years. After nine years, the risk falls to background. When AML occurs, it is often preceded by a [[myelodysplastic syndrome]] phase, before developing into overt acute leukemia. Cyclophosphamide-induced leukemia will often involve complex [[cytogenetics]], which carries a worse prognosis than ''de novo'' AML.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===Short-term===
Acute adverse effects are usually the result of high or multiple doses, although single dose toxicity can occur in susceptible individuals. The most serious short-term physical health risks of MDMA are [[hyperthermia]] and [[dehydration]]. Cases of life-threatening or fatal [[hyponatremia]] (excessively low sodium concentration in the blood) have developed in MDMA users attempting to prevent dehydration by consuming excessive amounts of water without replenishing [[electrolytes]].
* [[Hyperthermia]]
* [[Bruxism]] (grinding and clenching of the teeth)
* Increased wakefulness or [[insomnia]]
* Increased perspiration and sweating
* Increased [[heart rate]] and [[blood pressure]]
* Increased psychomotor activity
* Loss of [[appetite]]
* Nausea and vomiting
* [[Diarrhea]]
* [[Erectile dysfunction]]
* Visual and auditory hallucinations (rarely)
* [[Mydriasis]]

===Long-term===
{{As of|2015}}, the long-term effects of MDMA on human brain structure and function have not been fully determined. In contrast, there is no evidence of structural or functional changes in MDMA users with only a moderate (&lt;50 doses used and &lt;100 tablets consumed) lifetime exposure. It is unclear if typical MDMA users may develop neurotoxic brain lesions. Long-term exposure to MDMA in humans has been shown to produce marked [[neurodegeneration]] in [[striatal]], [[hippocampal]], [[prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]], and [[occipital cortex|occipital]] serotonergic [[axon terminal]]s. Elevations in brain temperature from MDMA use are positively correlated with MDMA-induced neurotoxicity. Adverse [[neuroplastic]] changes to brain [[microvasculature]] and [[white matter]] also occur in humans using low doses of MDMA. Reduced [[gray matter]] density in certain brain structures has also been noted in human MDMA users. Global reductions in gray matter volume, thinning of the parietal and orbitofrontal cortices, and decreased hippocampal activity have been observed in long term users. The effects established so far for recreational use of ecstasy lie in the range of moderate to large effects for SERT reduction.

Impairments in multiple aspects of cognition, including attention, learning, memory, visual processing, and sleep have been found in regular MDMA users. The magnitude of these impairments is correlated with lifetime MDMA usage and are partially reversible with abstinence. Several forms of memory are impaired by chronic ecstasy use; however, the effect sizes for memory impairments in ecstasy users are generally small overall.

Serotonin depletion following MDMA use can cause depression in subsequent days. In some cases depressive symptoms persist for longer. Some studies indicate repeated recreational users of ecstasy have increased rates of depression and anxiety, even after quitting the drug. Depression is one of the main factors for cessation of use.

At high doses, MDMA induces a [[neuroimmune system|neuroimmune response]] which, through several mechanisms, increases the permeability of the [[blood-brain barrier]], thereby making the brain more susceptible to environmental toxins and [[pathogen]]s.]]
MDMA is a moderately [[teratogenic drug]] (i.e., it is toxic to the fetus). and impaired motor functioning. Motor delays may be temporary during infancy or long-term. The severity of these developmental delays increases with heavier MDMA use. Some of these symptoms include fatigue, loss of appetite, depression, and trouble concentrating. [[Drug tolerance|Tolerance]] to some of the desired&lt;!-- (e.g., euphoria) - need ref--&gt; and adverse&lt;!-- (e.g., loss of appetite) - need ref--&gt; effects of MDMA is expected to occur with consistent MDMA use. A 2007 analysis estimated MDMA to have a psychological dependence and physical dependence potential roughly three fourths and four fifths that of cannabis.

&lt;!--Addiction--&gt;
MDMA has been shown to induce [[ΔFosB]] in the [[nucleus accumbens]]. MDMA is less addictive than other stimulants such as methamphetamine and cocaine. Compared with amphetamine, MDMA and its metabolite MDA are less reinforcing.

&lt;!--Diagnostic criteria--&gt;
One study found approximately 15% of chronic MDMA users met the [[DSM-IV]] diagnostic criteria for [[substance dependence]]. However, there is little evidence for a specific diagnosable MDMA dependence syndrome because MDMA is typically used relatively infrequently.

&lt;!--Treatment--&gt;
There are currently no medications to treat MDMA addiction.

===Harm assessment===
A 2007 UK study ranked MDMA 18th in harmfulness out of 20 recreational drugs. Rankings for each drug were based on the risk for acute physical harm, the propensity for physical and psychological dependency on the drug, and the negative familial and societal impacts of the drug. The authors did not evaluate or rate the negative impact of ecstasy on the cognitive health of ecstasy users (e.g. impaired memory and concentration).

    <title>Clorazepate</title>

Adverse effects of clorazepate include, [[drug tolerance|tolerance]], [[drug dependence|dependence]], [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] reactions, cognitive impairment, [[confusion]], [[anterograde amnesia]], falls in the elderly, [[ataxia]], hangover effects, and drowsiness. It is unclear whether cognitive deficits resulting from the [[long-term use of benzodiazepines]] return to normal or persist indefinitely after withdrawal from benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines are also known to cause or worsen [[Major depression|depression]]. [[Paradoxical effects]] including excitement and paradoxical worsening of seizures can sometimes result from the use of benzodiazepines. Children, the elderly, individuals with a history of [[alcohol abuse]] or a history of aggressive behavior and anger are at greater risk of developing paradoxical reactions to benzodiazepines. However, tolerance to the [[active metabolite]] of clorazepate may occur more slowly than with other benzodiazepines. Regular use of benzodiazepines causes the development of dependence characterised by tolerance to the therapeutic effects of benzodiazepines and the development of the [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]] including symptoms such as [[anxiety]], [[apprehension (fear)|apprehension]], [[tremor]], [[insomnia]], [[nausea]], and [[vomiting]] upon cessation of benzodiazepine use. Withdrawal from benzodiazepines should be gradual as abrupt withdrawal from high doses of benzodiazepines may cause [[confusion]], [[toxic psychosis]], [[convulsions]], or a condition resembling [[delirium tremens]]. Abrupt withdrawal from lower doses may cause depression, [[Anxiety|nervousness]], [[rebound insomnia]], [[irritability]], [[sweating]], and [[diarrhea]].

    <title>Diclofenac</title>

Diclofenac consumption has been associated with significantly increased vascular and coronary risk in a study including coxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen and naproxen. Major vascular events were increased by about a third by diclofenac, chiefly due to an increase in major coronary events. Compared with placebo, of 1000 patients allocated to diclofenac for a year, three more had major vascular events, one of which was fatal. Vascular death was increased significantly by diclofenac.

===Cardiac===
In 2013, a study funded by core grants from the UK Medical Research Council and the British Heart Foundations, and collaboration coordinated by the Clinical Trial Service Unit &amp; Epidemiological Studies Unit (CTSU) at the University of Oxford, UK; major vascular events were increased by about a third by diclofenac (rate ratio 1·41,95% CI 1·12–1·78; p=0·0036), chiefly due to an increase in major coronary events (1·70, 1·19–2·41; p=0·0032). Compared with placebo, of 1000 patients allocated to diclofenac for a year, three more had major vascular events, one of which was fatal. Vascular death was increased significantly by diclofenac (1·65, 0·95–2·85, p=0·0187).

Following the identification of increased risks of heart attacks with the selective [[COX-2 inhibitor]] [[rofecoxib]] in 2004, attention has focused on all the other members of the NSAIDs group, including diclofenac. Research results are mixed, with a meta-analysis of papers and reports up to April 2006 suggesting a relative increased rate of heart disease of 1.63 compared to nonusers. However, diclofenac appears to have a different mechanism of renal toxicity.
* Studies in Pakistan showed diclofenac caused acute kidney failure in vultures when they ate the carcasses of animals that had recently been treated with it. Drug-sensitive species and individual humans are initially assumed to lack genes expressing specific drug detoxification enzymes.

===Mental health===
*Mental health side effects have been reported. These symptoms are rare, but exist in significant enough numbers to include as potential side effects. These include depression, anxiety, irritability, nightmares, and psychotic reactions.

    <title>Duloxetine</title>

[[Nausea]], [[somnolence]], [[insomnia]], and [[dizziness]] are the main [[side effects]], reported by about 10% to 20% of patients.

In a trial for major depressive disorder (MDD), the most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events among duloxetine-treated patients were [[nausea]] (34.7%), [[dry mouth]] (22.7%), [[headache]] (20.0%) and [[dizziness]] (18.7%), and except for [[headache]], these were reported significantly more often than in the placebo group. In a long-term study of fibromyalgia patients receiving duloxetine, frequency and type of adverse effects was similar to that reported in the MDD above. Side effects tended to be mild-to-moderate, and tended to decrease in intensity over time.

[[Sexual dysfunction]] is often a side effect of drugs that inhibit serotonin reuptake. Specifically, common side effects include difficulty becoming aroused, lack of interest in sex, and [[anorgasmia]] (trouble achieving orgasm). Loss of or decreased response to sexual stimuli and ejaculatory [[anhedonia]] are also possible. Frequency of treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction in long-term treatment has been found to be similar for duloxetine and SSRIs when compared in clinical trials,

===Discontinuation syndrome===
{{Further information|SSRI discontinuation syndrome}}
During marketing of other SSRIs and SNRIs, there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: [[Dysphoria|dysphoric mood]], irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., [[paresthesias]] such as [[brain zap]] electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, [[Labile affect|emotional lability]], [[insomnia]], [[hypomania]], [[tinnitus]], and seizures. The [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] syndrome from duloxetine resembles the [[SSRI discontinuation syndrome]].

When discontinuing treatment with duloxetine, the manufacturer recommends a gradual reduction in the dose, rather than abrupt cessation, whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate.

In placebo-controlled clinical trials of up to nine weeks' duration of patients with MDD, a systematic evaluation of discontinuation symptoms in patients taking duloxetine following abrupt discontinuation found the following symptoms occurring at a rate greater than or equal to 2% and at a significantly higher rate in duloxetine-treated patients compared to those discontinuing from placebo: dizziness, nausea, headache, paresthesia, vomiting, irritability, and nightmare.

===Suicidality===
The FDA requires all antidepressants, including duloxetine, to carry a [[black box warning]] stating that antidepressants may increase the risk of suicide in persons younger than 25. This warning is based on statistical analyses conducted by two independent groups of the FDA experts that found a 2-fold increase of the suicidal ideation and behavior in children and adolescents, and 1.5-fold increase of suicidality in the 18–24 age group.

To obtain [[statistically significant]] results the FDA had to combine the results of 295 trials of 11 antidepressants for psychiatric indications. As [[suicidal ideation]] and behavior in clinical trials are rare, the results for any drug taken separately usually do not reach statistical significance.

In 2005 the United States FDA released a public health advisory noting that there had been 11 reports of suicide attempts and 3 reports of suicidality within the mostly middle-aged women participating in the open label extension trials of duloxetine for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence. The FDA described the potential role of confounding social stressors &quot;unclear&quot;. The suicide attempt rate in the SUI study population (based on 9,400 patients) was calculated to be 400 per 100,000 person years. This rate is greater than the suicide attempt rate among middle-aged U.S. women that has been reported in published studies, i.e., 150 to 160 per 100,000 person years. In addition, one death from suicide was reported in a Cymbalta clinical pharmacology study in a healthy female volunteer without SUI. No increase in suicidality was reported in controlled trials of Cymbalta for depression or diabetic neuropathic pain.

===Postmarketing reports===
Reported adverse events which were temporally correlated to duloxetine therapy include rash, reported rarely, and the following adverse events, reported very rarely: [[alanine aminotransferase]] increased, [[alkaline phosphatase]] increased, [[anaphylactic]] reaction, [[angioneurotic edema]], [[aspartate aminotransferase]] increased, [[bilirubin]] increased, [[glaucoma]], [[hepatotoxicity]], [[hyponatremia]], [[jaundice]], [[orthostatic hypotension]] (especially at the initiation of treatment), [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]], [[syncope (medicine)|syncope]] (especially at initiation of treatment), and [[urticaria]].

Common [[side effect]]s of desogestrel may include [[menstrual irregularities]], [[amenorrhea]], [[headache]]s, [[nausea]], [[breast tenderness]], and [[mood (psychology)|mood]] changes (e.g., [[depression (mood)|depression]]), as well as [[weight gain]], [[acne]], and [[hirsutism]]. However, it has also been reported to not adversely affect weight. In addition, acne and hirsutism are negligible when combined with [[ethinylestradiol]], and this combination can actually be used to treat such symptoms. Desogestrel can also cause changes in total, {{abbrlink|LDL|low-density lipoprotein}}, and {{abbrlink|HDL|high-density lipoprotein}} [[cholesterol]]. Uncommon side effects of desogestrel may include [[vaginal infection]], [[contact lens]] intolerance, [[vomiting]], [[alopecia|hair loss]], [[dysmenorrhea]], [[ovarian cyst]]s, and [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], while rare side effects include [[rash]], [[urticaria]], and [[erythema nodosum]]. [[Breast discharge]], [[ectopic pregnancies]], and aggravation of [[angioedema]] may also occur with desogestrel. Serious side effects of combined oral contraceptives containing desogestrel may include [[venous thromboembolism]], [[arterial thromboembolism]], [[hormone-dependent tumor]]s (e.g., [[liver tumor]]s, [[breast cancer]]), and [[melasma]].

===Hepatic veno-occlusive disease===

The major concern that has inhibited the use of thioguanine has been veno-occlusive disease (VOD) and its histological precursor nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH). The incidence of NRH with thioguanine was reported  as between 33–76%. The risk of ensuing VOD is serious and frequently irreversible so this side effect has been a major concern.
However, recent evidence using an animal model for thioguanine-induced NRH/VOD has shown that, contrary to previous assumptions, NRH/VOD is dose dependent and the mechanism for this has been demonstrated. This has been confirmed in human trials, where thioguanine has proven to be safe but efficacious for coeliac disease when used at doses below those commonly prescribed. This has led to a revival of interest in thioguanine because of its higher efficacy and faster action compared to other thiopurines and immunosuppressants such as mycophenylate.

===First generation===
An estimated 3 million pregnant women in the USA were prescribed DES from 1941 through 1971.

Various neurological changes occur after prenatal exposure of embryonic males to DES and other estrogenic endocrine disrupters. Animals that exhibited these structural neurological changes were also shown to demonstrate various gender-related behavioral changes (so-called &quot;feminization of males&quot;).

====DES Daughters and Sons====
A study of around 5,600 women and 2,600 men who had documented prenatal exposure to DES, called &quot;DES Daughters&quot; and &quot;DES Sons&quot;, respectively, found that &quot;DES Daughters were just as likely as unexposed women to be left-handed. DES Sons were slightly more likely to be left-handed than unexposed men (14% vs. 11%, respectively). The researchers found no association between DES exposure and reported mental illness in DES Daughters, although the authors cautioned that this aspect may be under-represented due to the nature of self-reported data. In addition, no association was found between DES exposure and anorexia or bulimia.&quot;

===Psychological anomalies===
Most of the initial research documenting the psychological effects of prenatal DES exposure was poorly conducted, often by mail card. Despite that, some more carefully conducted studies show a clear link to depression, and a more recent French study asserts that there was an 83% increase in psychological disorders for offspring that were prenatally exposed to DES.

===Third generation===
Current research also looks at DES in the third generation. These are the grandchildren of women who were given DES during pregnancy and whose mother or father was therefore exposed to DES ''in utero''. Studies of the third generation are important because DES might be associated with [[epigenetics|epigenetic]] changes, which involve changes to the way genes behave (not involving the DNA itself) that may be heritable from one generation to another. If epigenetic changes occur and are heritable, studies of the DES-exposed third generation have implications for the influence of environmental endocrine disruptors on human health and evolution.

Recent studies from the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) show that the daughters of women who were exposed ''in utero'' to DES may be less likely than the unexposed to have regular menstrual periods. A possible increased risk of infertility in the older, third generation daughters was also noted. The NCI study provides limited evidence of an increased risk of birth defects in the sons or daughters of women who were exposed prenatally to DES. An increased risk of ovarian cancer in the daughters of women exposed ''in utero'' was observed, but it was based on three cases of almost 800, so the finding is considered preliminary and requires further study.

Some evidence suggests the sons of prenatally DES-exposed women might have an increased risk of [[hypospadias]], but other studies suggest the increase in risk might not be as great as once thought.

    <title>Indinavir</title>

The most common side effects of indinavir include:
* Gastrointestinal disturbances (abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting)
* General malaise and [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]]
* Nephrolithiasis/urolithiasis (the formation of [[kidney stone]]s), which sometimes may lead to more severe condition including [[Chronic kidney disease|kidney failure]]
* [[Metabolic]] alterations including [[hyperlipidemia]] ([[cholesterol]] or [[triglyceride]] elevations) and [[hyperglycemia]]
* Alterations in body shape ([[lipodystrophy]]), colloquially known as &quot;Crix belly&quot;

Indinavir inhibits urinary nitrous oxide production and may inhibit nitric oxide production.  Treatment with this drug is frequently associated with renal abnormalities, sterile leukocyturia, and reduced [[creatinine clearance]].

Indinavir impairs endothelial function in healthy HIV-negative men and may accelerate [[atherosclerotic]] disease.

    <title>Sulpiride</title>

Sulpiride is usually well-tolerated, producing few adverse effects. Their incidences are as follows:

;Common (&gt;1%) adverse effects:
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Extrapyramidal side effects
:- Tremor
:- Dystonia
:- [[Akathisia]] — a sense of inner restlessness that presents itself with the inability to stay still
:- [[Parkinsonism]]
* Somnolence (not a very prominent adverse effect considering its lack of α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; adrenergic, histamine and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor affinity)
* Insomnia
* Weight gain or loss
* [[Hyperprolactinemia]] (elevated plasma levels of the hormone, [[prolactin]] which can, in turn lead to sexual dysfunction, [[galactorrhea]], [[amenorrhea]], [[gynecomastia]], etc.)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Nasal congestion
* [[Anticholinergic]] adverse effects such as:
:- Dry mouth
:- Constipation
:- Blurred vision
* Impaired concentration

;Rare (&lt;1% incidence) adverse effects:
* [[Tardive dyskinesia]] — a rare, often permanent movement disorder that, more often than not, results from prolonged treatment with antidopaminergic agents such as antipsychotics. It presents with slow (hence ''tardive''), involuntary, repetitive and purposeless movements that most often affect the facial muscles. 
* [[Neuroleptic malignant syndrome]] — a rare, life-threatening complication that results from the use of antidopaminergic agents. Its incidence increases with concomitant use of [[lithium (medication)]] salts
* Blood dyscrasias — rare, sometimes life-threatening complications of the use of a number of different antipsychotics (most notably clozapine) which involves abnormalities in the composition of a person's blood (e.g. having too few white blood cells per unit volume of blood). Examples include: 
:- [[Agranulocytosis]] — a significant drop in white blood cell count, leaving individuals wide open to life-threatening opportunistic infections
:- [[Neutropenia]]
:- [[Leucopenia]]
:- [[Leukocytosis]]
* Seizures
* [[Torsades de pointes]]

;Unknown incidence adverse effects include:
* [[QTc interval]] prolongation which can lead to potentially fatal [[arrhythmias]].
* Cholestatic jaundice
* Elevated liver enzymes
* Primary biliary cirrhosis
* Allergic reactions
* Photosensitivity — sensitivity to light
* Skin rashes
* Depression
* [[Catatonia]]
* Palpitations
* Agitation
* [[Diaphoresis]] — sweating without a precipitating factor (e.g. increased ambient temperature)
* Hypotension — low blood pressure
* Hypertension — high blood pressure
* [[Venous thromboembolism]] (probably ''rare'')

=== Contraindications and cautions===
'''Contraindications'''

* Hypersensitivity to sulpiride
* Pre-existing breast cancer or other prolactin-dependent tumors
* [[Phaeochromocytoma]]
* Intoxication with other centrally-active drugs
* Concomitant use of [[levodopa]]
* Acute porphyria
* Comatose state or CNS depression
* Bone-marrow suppression

'''Cautions'''
* Pre-existing [[Parkinson's Disease]]
* Patients below 18 years of age (insufficient clinical data)
* Pre-existing severe heart disease/[[bradycardia]], or [[hypokalemia]] (predisposing to [[long QT syndrome]] and severe [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]]s)
* Patients with pre-existing [[epilepsy]]. [[Anticonvulsant]] therapy should be maintained
* Lithium use — increased risk of neurological side effects of both drugs

=== Overdose ===
Sulpiride has a relatively low order of acute toxicity. Substantial amounts may cause severe but reversible dystonic crises with [[torticollis]], protrusion of the tongue, and/or [[trismus]]. In some cases all the classical symptoms typical of severe Parkinson's disease may be noted; in others, over-sedation/coma may occur. The treatment is largely symptomatic. Some or all extrapyramidal reactions may respond to the application of anticholinergic drugs such as [[biperiden]] or [[benzatropine]]. All patients should be closely monitored for signs of [[long QT syndrome]] and severe arrhythmias.

Quazepam has fewer side effects than other benzodiazepines and less potential to induce [[drug tolerance|tolerance]] and [[rebound effects]]. There is significantly less potential for quazepam to induce [[respiratory depression]] or to adversely affect motor coordination than other [[benzodiazepines]]. The different side effect profile of quazepam may be due to its more selective binding profile to type 1 benzodiazepine receptors.

Sulfasalazine metabolizes to sulfapyridine. Serum levels should be monitored every three months, and more frequently at the outset. Serum levels above 50 μg/l are associated with side effects.
In rare cases, Sulfasalazine can cause severe [[depression (mood)|depression]] in young males. It can also cause temporary [[infertility]]. Immune [[thrombocytopenia]] has been reported.

Sulfasalazine inhibits [[dihydropteroate synthase]], and can cause [[folate deficiency]] and [[megaloblastic anemia]]. and various other undesirable effects.

Sulfasalazine can cause [[hemolytic anemia]] in people with [[G6PD deficiency]].

Sulfasalazine may cause stomach upset, [[nausea]], vomiting, loss of [[appetite]], headache, [[dizziness]], or unusual tiredness. Skin and urine can become orange, with occasional allergic reactions.

Side effects of loprazolam are generally the same as for other benzodiazepines such as [[diazepam]]. The most significant difference in side effects of loprazolam and diazepam is it is less prone to day time sedation as the half-life of loprazolam is considered to be intermediate whereas diazepam has a very long half-life. The side effects of loprazolam are the following:

* [[drowsiness]]

===Sexual dysfunction===
{{See also|Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor#Sexual dysfunction}}
Sexual dysfunction, including loss of libido, anorgasmia, lack of vaginal lubrication, and erectile dysfunction, is one of the most commonly encountered adverse effects of treatment with fluoxetine and other SSRIs. While early clinical trials suggested a relatively low rate of sexual dysfunction, more recent studies in which the investigator actively inquires about sexual problems suggest that the incidence is &gt;70%.  Symptoms of sexual dysfunction have been reported to persist after discontinuing SSRIs, although this is thought to be occasional. Similarly, the analysis conducted by the UK [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency|MHRA]] found a 50% increase of odds of suicide-related events, not reaching statistical significance, in the children and adolescents on fluoxetine as compared to the ones on placebo. According to the MHRA data, for adults fluoxetine did not change the rate of [[self-harm]] and statistically significantly decreased suicidal ideation by 50%.

Acitretin is noted for the possibility of severe birth defects and should not be used by pregnant women or women planning to get pregnant within 3 years following the use of acitretin.  Sexually active women of childbearing age who use acitretin should also use at least two forms of birth control concurrently. Men and women who use it should not donate blood for three years after using it, because of the possibility that the blood might be used in a pregnant patient and cause birth defects.  In addition, it may cause nausea, headache, itching, dry, red or flaky skin, dry or red eyes, dry or chapped lips, swollen lips, dry mouth, thirst, cystitis acne or hair loss.

On 29 November 2006, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] issued a Public Health Advisory about methadone titled &quot;Methadone Use for Pain Control May Result in Death and Life-Threatening Changes in Breathing and Heart Beat&quot;. The advisory said that &quot;the FDA has received reports of death and life-threatening side effects in patients taking methadone. These deaths and life-threatening side effects have occurred in patients newly starting methadone for pain control and in patients who have switched to methadone after being treated for pain with other strong opioid pain relievers. Methadone can cause slow or shallow breathing and dangerous changes in heartbeat that may not be felt by the patient.&quot; The advisory urged that physicians use caution when prescribing methadone to people who are not used to the drug and that people take the drug exactly as directed.

Methadone withdrawal symptoms are reported as being significantly more protracted than withdrawal from opioids with shorter half-lives.

Methadone is sometimes administered as an oral liquid. Methadone has been implicated in contributing to significant [[tooth decay]]. Methadone causes [[xerostomia|dry mouth]], reducing the protective role of [[saliva]] in preventing decay. Other putative mechanisms of methadone-related tooth decay include craving for carbohydrates related to opioids, poor dental care, and general decrease in personal hygiene. These factors, combined with sedation, have been linked to the causation of extensive dental damage.

===Overdose===
Most people who have overdosed on methadone may show some of the following symptoms:
* [[Miosis]] (constricted pupils)
* [[Drowsiness]], sleepiness, disorientation, sedation, unresponsiveness
* Skin that is cool, clammy (damp), and pale
* Limp muscles, trouble staying awake, nausea
* [[Unconsciousness]] and [[coma]]
* Death

The respiratory depression of an overdose can be treated with [[naloxone]]. Naloxone is preferred to the newer, longer acting antagonist [[naltrexone]]. Despite methadone's much longer duration of action compared to either heroin and other shorter-acting agonists, and the need for repeat doses of the antagonist naloxone, it is still used for overdose therapy. As naltrexone has a longer half-life, it is more difficult to titrate. If too large a dose of the opioid antagonist is given to a dependent person, it will result in withdrawal symptoms (possibly severe). When using naloxone, the naloxone will be quickly eliminated and the withdrawal will be short lived. Doses of naltrexone take longer to be eliminated from the person's system. A common problem in treating methadone overdoses is that, given the short action of naloxone (versus the extremely longer-acting methadone), a dosage of naloxone given to a methadone-overdosed person will initially work to bring the person out of overdose, but once the naloxone wears off, if no further naloxone is administered, the person can go right back into overdose (based upon time and dosage of the methadone ingested).

===Tolerance and dependence===
As with other opioid medications, tolerance and dependence usually develop with repeated doses. There is some clinical evidence that tolerance to analgesia is less with methadone compared to other opioids; this may be due to its activity at the NMDA receptor. Tolerance to the different physiological effects of methadone varies; tolerance to analgesic properties may or may not develop quickly, but tolerance to euphoria usually develops rapidly, whereas tolerance to constipation, sedation, and respiratory depression develops slowly (if ever).

===Driving===
Methadone treatment may impair driving ability. Drug abusers had significantly more involvement in serious crashes than non-abusers in a study by the University of Queensland. In the study of a group of 220 drug abusers, most of them poly-drug abusers, 17 were involved in crashes killing people, compared with a control group of other people randomly selected having no involvement in fatal crashes. However, there have been multiple studies verifying the ability of methadone maintenance patients to drive.
In the UK, persons who are prescribed oral Methadone can continue to drive after they have satisfactorily completed an independent medical examination which will include a urine screen for drugs. The licence will be issued for 12 months at a time and even then, only following a favourable assessment from their own doctor. Individuals who are prescribed methadone for either IV or IM administration cannot drive in the UK, mainly due to the increased sedation effects that this route of use can cause.

===Mortality===
In the United States, deaths linked to methadone more than quadrupled in the five-year period between 1999 and 2004. According to the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, as well as a 2006 series in the ''Charleston Gazette'' (West Virginia), medical examiners listed methadone as contributing to 3,849 deaths in 2004. That number was up from 790 in 1999. Approximately 82 percent of those deaths were listed as accidental, and most deaths involved combinations of methadone with other drugs (especially [[benzodiazepines]]).

Although deaths from methadone are on the rise, methadone-associated deaths are not being caused primarily by methadone intended for methadone treatment programs, according to a panel of experts convened by the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]], which released a report titled &quot;Methadone-Associated Mortality, Report of a National Assessment&quot;. The consensus report concludes that &quot;although the data remains incomplete, National Assessment meeting participants concurred that methadone tablets or diskettes distributed through channels other than opioid treatment programs most likely are the central factors in methadone-associated mortality.&quot;

In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a caution about methadone, titled “Methadone Use for Pain Control May Result in Death.” The FDA also revised the drug's package insert. The change deleted previous information about the usual adult dosage. The ''Charleston Gazette'' reported, &quot;The old language about the 'usual adult dose' was potentially deadly, according to pain specialists.&quot;

Levocetirizine is called a non-sedating antihistamine as it does not enter the brain in significant amounts, and is therefore unlikely to cause drowsiness. However, some people may experience some slight [[sleepiness]], [[headache]], [[Xerostomia|mouth dryness]], [[lightheadedness]], vision problems (mainly [[blurred vision]]), [[palpitations]] and [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]].

    <title>Flunitrazepam</title>

Adverse effects of flunitrazepam include dependence, both physical and psychological; reduced sleep quality resulting in [[somnolence]]; and [[overdose]], resulting in excessive sedation, impairment of balance and speech, respiratory depression or coma, and possibly death. Because of the latter, flunitrazepam is commonly used in suicide.{{cn|date=June 2017}} When used in pregnancy, it might cause [[hypotonia]].

===Dependence===
Flunitrazepam as with other [[benzodiazepine]]s can lead to [[drug dependence]] and [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]]. Discontinuation may result in the appearance of [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome|withdrawal symptoms]] when the drug is discontinued. Abrupt withdrawal may lead to a [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]] characterised by [[seizures]], [[psychosis]], insomnia, and [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]]. [[Rebound insomnia]], worse than baseline insomnia, typically occurs after discontinuation of flunitrazepam even after short-term single nightly dose therapy.

===Sleep depth===
{{medref|section|date=October 2017}}
Flunitrazepam produces a decrease in [[delta wave]] activity. The effect of benzodiazepine drugs on delta waves, however, may not be mediated via benzodiazepine receptors. Delta activity is an indicator of depth of sleep within non-REM sleep; increased levels of delta sleep reflects better quality of sleep. Thus, flunitrazepam and other benzodiazepines{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} cause a deterioration in sleep quality. [[Cyproheptadine]] may be superior to benzodiazepines in the treatment of insomnia as it enhances sleep quality based on [[EEG]] studies.

===Paradoxical effects===
Flunitrazepam may cause a [[paradoxical reaction]] in some individuals causing symptoms including anxiety, [[aggressiveness]], [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]], [[confusion]], [[disinhibition]], loss of [[impulse control]], talkativeness, [[violent]] behavior, and even [[convulsions]]. [[Paradoxical adverse effects]] may even lead to [[criminal behaviour]].

===Hypotonia===
{{See also|Hypotonia}}
Benzodiazepines such as flunitrazepam are lipophilic and rapidly penetrate membranes and, therefore, rapidly cross over into the [[placenta]] with significant uptake of the drug. Use of benzodiazepines including flunitrazepam in late pregnancy, especially high doses, may result in hypotonia, also known as floppy baby syndrome.

===Other===
Flunitrazepam impairs [[cognitive]] functions. This may appear as lack of concentration, [[confusion]] and [[anterograde amnesia]]. It can be described as a [[hangover]]-like effect which can persist to the next day. It also impairs psychomotor functions similar to other benzodiazepines and [[nonbenzodiazepine]] [[hypnotic]] drugs; falls and hip fractures were frequently reported. The combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial, but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments.

Other adverse effects include:
* Slurred speech
* [[Gastrointestinal disturbance]]s, lasting 12 or more hours
* Vomiting
* [[Respiratory depression]] in higher doses
;Special precautions
Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, in alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals, and in individuals with [[comorbid]] [[psychiatric disorders]].

Impairment of driving skills with a resultant increased risk of [[road traffic accidents]] is probably the most important adverse effect. This side-effect is not unique to flunitrazepam but also occurs with other [[hypnotic]] drugs. Flunitrazepam seems to have a particularly high risk of road traffic accidents compared to other hypnotic drugs. Extreme caution should be exercised by drivers after taking flunitrazepam.

    <title>Goserelin</title>

Goserelin acetate may cause a temporary increase in bone pain and symptoms of [[prostatic cancer]] during the first few weeks of treatment. This is known as the tumour flare effect, and is the result of an initial increase in [[luteinizing hormone]] production, before the receptors are desensitised and hormonal production is inhibited. The symptoms will disappear, with hormonal inhibition. It is therefore advisable to co-treat with an [[antiandrogen]] during the first 2–3 weeks of goserelin treatment, particularly in patients with pre-existing bone symptoms.

Goserelin may cause [[bone pain]], [[hot flushes]], [[headache]], [[Abdominal pain|stomach upset]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[Urinary retention|difficulty urinating]] (isolated cases), [[weight gain]], [[Mastodynia|swelling and tenderness of breasts]] (infrequent), [[Erectile dysfunction|decreased erections]] and [[Libido#Libido impairment|reduced sexual desire]]. Bone pain can be managed symptomatically, and erectile dysfunction can be treated by [[Levitra]] ([[Vardenafil]]) or other similar oral therapies, although they will not treat the reduced sexual desire.

The reactions were mild to moderate in severity; 2% of people had severe reactions and these were generally [[cellulitis]].

More than 10% of people had [[edema]], headache, cough, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, muscle pain, or joint pain.

    <title>Triazolam</title>

[[Adverse drug reactions]] associated with the use of triazolam include:

* Relatively common  (&gt;1% of patients): [[somnolence]], [[dizziness]], feeling of lightness, coordination problems.
* Less common  (0.9% to 0.5% of patients): [[euphoria]], [[tachycardia]], tiredness, confusional states/memory impairment, cramps/pain, [[Depression (mood)|depression]], visual disturbances.
* Rare (&lt;0.5% of patients): constipation, taste alteration, [[diarrhea]], dry mouth, [[dermatitis]]/allergy, dreams/nightmares, insomnia, [[parasthesia]], [[tinnitus]], [[dysesthesia]], weakness, congestion. One study found no evidence of sustained hypnotic efficacy throughout the 9 weeks of treatment for triazolam.

In addition, the effectiveness and safety of long-term use of these agents remain to be determined. It was concluded that more research is needed to evaluate the long-term effects of treatment and the most appropriate management strategy for elderly persons with chronic insomnia.

Due to its vasodilation properties, the common side effects of salmeterol are [[dizziness]], [[Sinusitis|sinus infection]], and [[Migraine|migraine headaches]]. In most cases, salmeterol side effects are minor and either don't require treatment or can easily be treated. Certain side effects, however, should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately. Some of these more serious side effects include a very fast heart rate, [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]], and worsening [[Dyspnea|breathing problems]].

    <title>Leflunomide</title>

The dose-limiting side effects are liver damage, lung disease and immunosuppression. The most common side effects (occurring in &gt;1% of those treated with it) are, in approximately descending order of frequency: constipation, [[Oral candidiasis|oral thrush]], [[stomatitis]], taste disturbance, [[thrombocytopenia]] and [[urticaria|hives]]. Rarely (in 0.1% of those treated with it) it can cause: [[anaphylaxis]], [[angiooedema]], [[anaemia]], [[agranulocytosis]], [[eosinophilia]], [[leucopenia]], [[pancytopenia]], [[vasculitis]], [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]], [[Stevens-Johnson syndrome]], cutaneous [[lupus erythematosus]], severe infection, [[interstitial lung disease]], [[cirrhosis]] and [[liver failure]].

Though not reported elsewhere, 80 cases of [[interstitial pneumonitis]] involving leflunomide have been reported in Japan between 2003 and 2006. One such case resulting in a death was reported in a 2006 article from Japan and the authors suggest a &quot;an inter-racial difference&quot; for the interstitial pneumonitis.

===Contraindications===
Contraindications include:
{{colbegin|3}}
* Pregnancy, women of childbearing potential (unless contraception used)
* Liver disease, [[hepatitis B]]/[[Hepatitis C|C]] seropositive
* Active serious infections
* Hypersensitivity
{{colend}}

===Interactions===
Other immunomodulatory treatments should be avoided due to the potential for additive immunosuppressant effects, or in the case of immunostimulants like [[echinacea]] or [[astragalus]], reduced therapeutic effects. Likewise live vaccines (like [[haemophilus influenzae type b]] vaccine and [[yellow fever]] vaccines) should be avoided due to the potential for severe infection due to the immunosuppressive nature of the treatment.

The concomitant use of [[methotrexate]], in particular, may lead to severe or even fatal liver-damage or hepatotoxicity. Seventy-five percent of all cases of severe liver damage reported until early 2001 were seen under combined drug therapy leflunomide plus methotrexate. However, some studies have shown that the combination of methotrexate and leflunomide in patients with rheumatoid arthritis gave better results than either drug alone.

Common observed adverse reactions to alglucosidase alfa treatment are [[pneumonia]], respiratory complications, [[infection]]s and [[fever]]. More serious reactions reported include [[heart failure|heart]] and [[lung failure]] and [[allergy|allergic shock]]. Myozyme boxes carry warnings regarding the possibility of life-threatening allergic response.

    <title>Eplerenone</title>

Adverse effects of aldosterone occur in the heart and brain, due to changes in water retention and excretion of sodium and potassium. Common [[adverse drug reaction]]s (ADRs) associated with the use of eplerenone include: [[hyperkalaemia]], [[hypotension]], dizziness, altered renal function, and increased creatinine concentration. Eplerenone may have a lower incidence than spironolactone of sexual side effects such as [[feminization (biology)|feminization]], [[gynecomastia]], [[impotence]], low sex drive and reduction of size of male genitalia. When considering taking these medicines, it is important to note the variations in their ability to offset the nongenomic effects of aldosterone.

===Contraindications===
Eplerenone is contraindicated in patients with [[hyperkalaemia]], severe [[renal impairment]] (creatinine Cl less than 30 ml/min), or severe [[hepatic impairment]] ([[Child-Pugh score]] C). The manufacturer of eplerenone also contraindicates ( relative C.I. ) concomitant treatment with [[ketoconazole]], [[itraconazole]] or other [[potassium-sparing diuretic]]s (though the manufacturer still considers taking these drugs to be absolute C.I.) Potential benefits should be weighted against possible risks.

===Drug interactions===
Eplerenone is primarily metabolized by the [[Cytochrome P450 oxidase|cytochrome P450]] enzyme [[CYP3A4]]. Thus the potential exists for adverse drug interactions with other drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A4. Specifically, the concomitant use of the CYP3A4 potent inhibitors [[ketoconazole]] and [[itraconazole]] is contraindicated. Other CYP3A4 inhibitors including [[erythromycin]], [[saquinavir]], and [[verapamil]] should be used with caution. Other drugs that increase [[potassium]] concentrations may increase the risk of hyperkalemia associated with eplerenone therapy, including salt substitutes, potassium supplements and other [[potassium-sparing diuretic]]s.

 Effect of Manidipine

    <title>Indometacin</title>

In general, adverse effects seen with indometacin are similar to all other NSAIDs. For instance,  indometacin inhibits both [[PTGS1|cyclooxygenase-1]] and [[Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2|cyclooxygenase-2]], which then inhibits the production of prostaglandins in the [[stomach]] and [[intestines]] responsible for maintaining the [[mucus|mucous lining]] of the [[gastrointestinal tract]]. Indometacin, therefore, like other non-selective COX inhibitors can cause [[peptic ulcer]]s. These ulcers can result in serious bleeding and/or perforation requiring hospitalization of the patient.

To reduce the possibility of peptic ulcers, indometacin should be prescribed at the lowest dosage needed to achieve a therapeutic effect, usually between 50–200&amp;nbsp;mg/day. It should always be taken with food. Nearly all patients benefit from an ulcer protective drug (e.g. highly dosed antacids, [[ranitidine]] 150&amp;nbsp;mg at bedtime, or [[omeprazole]] 20&amp;nbsp;mg at bedtime). Other common gastrointestinal complaints, including [[dyspepsia]], [[heartburn]] and mild [[diarrhea]] are less serious and rarely require discontinuation of indometacin.

Many NSAIDs, but particularly indometacin, cause [[Lithium (medication)|lithium]] retention by reducing its excretion by the [[kidney]]s. Thus indometacin users have an elevated risk of lithium toxicity. For patients taking lithium (e.g. for treatment of [[clinical depression|depression]] or [[bipolar disorder]]), less toxic NSAIDs such as [[sulindac]] or [[aspirin]] are preferred.

All NSAIDs, including indometacin, also increase [[renin|plasma renin activity]] and [[aldosterone]] levels, and increase [[sodium]] and [[potassium]] retention. [[Vasopressin]] activity is also enhanced. Together these may lead to:

* [[Edema]] (swelling due to fluid retention)
* [[Hyperkalemia]] (high potassium levels)
* [[Hypernatremia]] (high sodium levels)
* [[Hypertension]]

Elevations of serum [[creatinine]] and more serious renal damage such as acute renal failure, chronic [[nephritis]] and [[nephrotic syndrome]], are also possible. These conditions also often begin with edema and hyperkalemia.

Paradoxically yet uncommonly, indometacin can cause headache (10 to 20%), sometimes with vertigo and dizziness, hearing loss, tinnitus, blurred vision (with or without retinal damage). There are unsubstantiated reports of worsening Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and psychiatric disorders. Cases of life-threatening shock (including [[angioedema]], sweating, severe [[hypotension]] and [[tachycardia]] as well as acute [[bronchospasm]]), severe or lethal [[hepatitis]] and severe bone marrow damage have all been reported. Skin reactions and [[photosensitivity]] are also possible side effects.

The frequency and severity of side effects and the availability of better tolerated alternatives make indometacin today a drug of second choice. Its use in acute [[gout]] attacks and in [[dysmenorrhea]] is well-established because in these indications the duration of treatment is limited to a few days only, therefore serious side effects are not likely to occur.

People should undergo regular physical examination to detect edema and signs of central nervous side effects. Blood pressure checks will reveal development of hypertension. Periodic serum electrolyte (sodium, potassium, chloride) measurements, complete blood cell counts and assessment of liver enzymes as well as of creatinine (renal function) should be performed. This is particularly important if Indometacin is given together with an [[ACE inhibitor]] or with potassium-sparing [[diuretic]]s, because these combinations can lead to [[hyperkalemia]] and/or serious kidney failure. No examinations are necessary if only the topical preparations (spray or gel) are applied.

Rare cases have shown that use of this medication by pregnant women can have an effect on the fetal heart, possibly resulting in fetal death via premature closing of the [[Ductus arteriosus]].

Naproxen should be taken orally with food to decrease the risk of [[Gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] side effects. Common adverse effects include dizziness, drowsiness, headache, rash, bruising, and gastrointestinal upset.

In the U.S., naproxen is sold with [[boxed warning]]s about the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration or bleeding.

[[COX-2]] selective and nonselective [[NSAIDs]] have been linked to increases in the number of serious and potentially fatal cardiovascular events, such as [[myocardial infarctions]] and [[stroke]]s. As with other non-COX-2 selective NSAIDs, naproxen can cause [[gastrointestinal problem]]s, such as heartburn, constipation, diarrhea, ulcers and stomach bleeding. Persons with a history of [[ulcers]] or [[inflammatory bowel disease]] should consult a doctor before taking naproxen.

A study found that high-dose naproxen induced near-complete suppression of platelet [[thromboxane]] throughout the dosing interval and appeared not to increase [[cardiovascular disease]] (CVD) risk, whereas other non-aspirin high-dose NSAID regimens had only transient effects on platelet [[COX-1]] and were associated with a small but definite vascular hazard. Conversely, naproxen was associated with higher rates of upper gastrointestinal bleeding complications compared with other NSAIDs.

Side effects include: dizziness, [[lethargy|drowsiness]], [[paresthesia|tingling of the hands or feet]], nausea, [[xerostomia|dry mouth]] and unsteadiness. If these effects persist or worsen, notify your doctor promptly. Side-effects which are unlikely and which should be promptly reported include: chest pain/pressure, throat pain/pressure, unusually fast/slow/irregular pulse, one-sided muscle weakness, vision problems, [[Raynaud's phenomenon|cold/bluish hands or feet]], stomach pain, bloody diarrhea, mental/mood changes, and [[Syncope (medicine)|fainting]]. In the unlikely event you have a serious allergic reaction to this drug, seek immediate medical attention. Symptoms of a [[anaphylaxis|serious allergic reaction]] include: rash, itching, swelling, severe dizziness, trouble breathing (swelling of the throat).

    <title>Carbamazepine</title>


In the US, the label for carbamazepine contains warnings concerning:
* effects on the [[Hematology|body's production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets]]:  rarely, there are major effects of [[aplastic anemia]] and [[agranulocytosis]] reported and more commonly, there are minor changes such as decreased [[Leukocyte|white blood cell]] or [[platelet]] counts, that do not progress to more serious problems. 
* increased risks of suicide
* increased risks of [[hyponatremia]] and [[SIADH]]
* risk of seizures, if the person stops taking the drug abruptly
* risks to the fetus in women who are pregnant, specifically congenital malformations like [[spina bifida]], and developmental disorders.

Common [[adverse drug reaction|adverse effects]] may include drowsiness, dizziness, headaches and migraines, [[motor coordination]] impairment, nausea, vomiting, and/or constipation. Alcohol use while taking carbamazepine may lead to enhanced depression of the [[central nervous system]].  Less common side effects may include increased risk of seizures in people with [[Causes of seizures#Diseases|mixed seizure disorders]], [[Heart arrhythmia|abnormal heart rhythms]], blurry or [[Diplopia|double vision]].  Also, rare case reports of an auditory side effect have been made, whereby patients perceive sounds about a [[semitone]] lower than previously; this unusual side effect is usually not noticed by most people, and disappears after the person stops taking carbamazepine.

===Interactions===
Carbamazepine has a potential for [[drug interaction]]s; caution should be used in combining other medicines with it, including other antiepileptics and mood stabilizers. Drugs that decrease the metabolism of carbamazepine or otherwise increase its levels include [[erythromycin]], Carbamazepine also increases the metabolism of the hormones in [[birth control pill]]s and can reduce their effectiveness, potentially leading to unexpected pregnancies. As a drug that induces cytochrome P450 enzymes, it accelerates elimination of many benzodiazepines and decreases their action. Carbamazepine increases the processing of [[methadone]] resulting in lower blood levels.

===Pharmacogenetics===
Serious skin reactions such as [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]] or [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]] due to carbamazepine therapy are more common in people with a particular [[human leukocyte antigen]] allele, [[HLA-B75|HLA-B*1502]]. However, the HLA-A*31:01 allele has been shown to be a strong predictor of both mild and severe adverse reactions, such as the [[DRESS syndrome]] form of severe cutaneous reactions, to carbamazepine among Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Europeans.

* [[Central nervous system]]: [[headache]]
* Whole body: [[fever]], [[phlebitis]] or thrombophlebitis, complications at the [[intravenous cannulation]] site (e.g. induration), unspecified pain, [[flu-like syndrome]], myalgia, chills, and [[paresthesia]]

Although melarsoprol cures about 96% of people with late stage disease, its toxicity limits its use. About 1-5% of people die from adverse events related to melarsoprol treatment. As a toxic organic compound of [[arsenic]], melarsoprol is a dangerous treatment that is typically only administered by injection under the supervision of a licensed physician. Notable side effects are similar to arsenic poisoning. Among clinicians, it is colloquially referred to as &quot;arsenic in antifreeze&quot;. Additional potentially serious side effects of melarsoprol include damage to the heart, presence of albumin in the urine that could be associated with kidney damage, and an increase in blood pressure.

* Cardiovascular events: &lt;!-- [US Boxed Warning]: --&gt; NSAIDs are associated with an increased risk of serious (and potentially fatal) adverse cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke. Risk may be increased with duration of use or pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors or disease. Individual cardiovascular risk profiles should be evaluated prior to prescribing. New-onset [[hypertension]] or exacerbation of [[hypertension]] may occur (NSAIDs may impair response to thiazide or loop diuretics), and may contribute to cardiovascular events; monitor blood pressure and use with caution in patients with hypertension. May cause sodium and fluid retention, use with caution in patients with edema or heart failure. Long-term cardiovascular risk in children has not been evaluated. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration of time, consistent with individual patient goals, to reduce risk of cardiovascular events; alternative therapies should be considered for patients at high risk.
* Gastrointestinal events: &lt;!-- [US Boxed Warning]: --&gt; NSAIDs may increase risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) ulceration, bleeding, and perforation (may be fatal). These events may occur at any time during therapy and without warning. Use caution with a history of GI disease (bleeding or ulcers), concurrent therapy with aspirin, anticoagulants and/or corticosteroids, smoking, use of alcohol, the elderly or debilitated patients. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration of time, consistent with individual patient goals, to reduce risk of GI adverse events; alternate therapies should be considered for patients at high risk. When used concomitantly with ≤325&amp;nbsp;mg of aspirin, a substantial increase in the risk of gastrointestinal complications (e.g., ulcer) occurs; concomitant gastroprotective therapy (e.g., proton pump inhibitors) is recommended.
* Hematologic effects: Anemia may occur; monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit in people on long-term treatment. Celecoxib does not usually affect [[prothrombin time]], [[partial thromboplastin time]] or [[platelet]] counts; it does not inhibit platelet aggregation at approved doses.

People with prior history of ulcer disease or GI bleeding require special precaution. Moderate to severe liver impairment or GI toxicity can occur with or without warning symptoms in people treated with NSAIDs.

===Allergy===
Celecoxib contains a [[sulfonamide (chemistry)|sulfonamide]] moiety and may cause allergic reactions in those allergic to other sulfonamide-containing drugs. This is in addition to the contraindication in people with severe allergies to other NSAIDs. However, it has a low (reportedly 4%) chance of inducing cutaneous reactions among persons who have a history of such reactions to aspirin or nonselective NSAIDs. NSAIDs may cause serious skin adverse events, including exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis; events may occur without warning and in patients without prior known sulfa allergy. Use should be discontinued at first sign of rash (or any other hypersensitivity).

===Heart attack and stroke===
The coxibs (which includes celecoxib) increase the risk of major cardiovascular problems by about 37%.

The COX-2 inhibitor [[rofecoxib]] (Vioxx) was removed from the market in 2004 due to its risk. Like all NSAIDs on the US market, celecoxib carries an FDA-mandated &quot;black box warning&quot; for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal risk. In February 2007, the [[American Heart Association]] warned that with respect to &quot;patients with a prior history of or at high risk for cardiovascular disease... use of COX-2 inhibitors for pain relief should be limited to patients for whom there are no appropriate alternatives, and then, only in the lowest dose and for the shortest duration necessary.&quot; If used concomitantly with lithium, celecoxib increases lithium plasma levels. If used concomitantly with warfarin, celecoxib may result in increased risk of bleeding complications. The drug may increase the risk of kidney failure with [[angiotensin]]-converting enzyme-inhibitors, such as [[lisinopril]], and [[diuretic]]s, such as [[hydrochlorothiazide]].

    <title>Maprotiline</title>

The side-effect profile is comparable to other TCAs and TeCAS and many of the following are due to [[anticholinergic]] (which are less prominent than those of most TCAs) and [[antihistamine]] effects. Most often seen are:

* [[Dizziness]]
* Drowsiness
* [[Somnolence]]
* [[Fatigue (medical)|Fatigue]]
* [[Xerostomia|Dry mouth]] (and complications of long-term uncontrolled dry mouth such as [[dental caries]]) 
* [[Constipation]]
* [[Vertigo]]
* [[Nausea]] (rare, incidence of ~2%) and vomiting
* Increased appetite and weight gain
* [[Orthostatic hypotension]], [[hypertension]], [[sinus tachycardia]], [[heart-block]], [[arrhythmias]] and other cardiac effects
* [[Sexual dysfunction]] in men: [[erectile dysfunction|impotence]], [[priapism]], [[delayed ejaculation]], [[anejaculation]], [[Hypoactive sexual disorder|decreased libido]]
* Sexual dysfunction in women: decreased libido, [[vaginal dryness]], [[Dyspareunia|painful sexual intercourse]], [[anorgasmia]]
* Allergic skin reactions such as [[rash]] or [[urticaria]] (more often than with other antidepressants). Rarely, severe skin reactions such as [[erythema multiforme]] can occur.
* [[Photosensitivity]]
* Agitation, confusion
* Induction of [[hypomania]] or [[mania]] in patients suffering from underlying [[bipolar affective disorder]]
* [[Psychotic]] symptoms
* [[Tremor]]
* [[Extrapyramidal symptoms]]
* [[Headache]]
* [[Seizure]]s (at high doses)
* Rare haematological complications: [[leukopenia]] and [[agranulocytosis]] (dangerous fall in white blood cells)
* [[Fever]]
* Urinary retention

Maprotiline causes a strong initial sedation (first 2 to 3 weeks of therapy) and is therefore indicated to treat agitated patients or those with suicidal risks. It causes [[anticholinergic]] side effects (dry mouth, constipation, confusion, tachycardia) with a lower incidence than [[amitriptyline]]. Originally, the manufacturer claimed that maprotiline is better tolerated than other TCAs and TeCAs. However, seizures, leukopenia and skin reactions occur more often with maprotiline than with comparable drugs like amitriptyline.

Maprotiline has no known potential for abuse and psychological dependence.

===Withdrawal===
Withdrawal symptoms frequently seen when treatment with maprotiline is stopped abruptly (agitation, anxiety, insomnia, sometimes activation of mania or rebound depression) are not indicative of addiction and can be avoided by reducing the daily dose of maprotiline gradually by approximately 25% each week. If treatment has to be stopped at once due to medical reasons, the use of a benzodiazepine (e.g. lorazepam, clonazepam, or alprazolam) for a maximum of 4 weeks as needed will usually suppress withdrawal symptoms.

===Overdose===
Gastric decontamination measures such as activated charcoal are sometimes recommended in cases of overdose. The symptoms are usually indicative of CNS depression (or conversely CNS stimulation in some) and excess anticholinergic side effects. The [[LD50|LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]] in mice is 123&amp;nbsp;mg/kg and 295&amp;nbsp;mg/kg in rats.

    <title>Enflurane</title>

Clinically, enflurane produces a dose-related depression of [[myocardial]] [[contractility]] with an associated decrease in myocardial oxygen consumption. Between 2% and 5% of the inhaled dose is oxidised in the liver, producing [[fluoride]] ions and difluoromethoxy-difluoroacetic acid. This is significantly higher than the metabolism of its structural isomer [[isoflurane]].

Enflurane also lowers the threshold for [[seizures]], and should especially not be used on people with [[epilepsy]].  Like all potent inhalation anaesthetic agents it is a known trigger of [[malignant hyperthermia]].

Like the other potent inhalation agents it relaxes the uterus in pregnant women which is associated with more blood loss at delivery or other procedures on the gravid uterus.

The obsolete (as an anaesthetic) agent [[methoxyflurane]] had a nephrotoxic effect and caused acute renal failure, usually attributed to the liberation of fluoride ions from its metabolism.  Enflurane is similarly metabolised but the liberation of fluoride results in a lower plasma level and enflurane related renal failure seemed unusual if seen at all.

When higher doses are used, as in the treatment of toxoplasmosis, pyrimethamine can cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, [[glossitis]], anorexia, and diarrhea. A rash, which can be indicative of a hypersensitivity reaction, is also seen, particularly in combination with sulfonamides. Central nervous system effects include ataxia, tremors, and seizures. Hematologic side effects such as [[thrombocytopenia]], [[leukopenia]], and anemia can also occur.

Toxicity may include interstitial [[pulmonary fibrosis]] (&quot;busulfan lung&quot;), [[hyperpigmentation]], [[seizures]], hepatic ([[veno-occlusive disease]]) (VOD), emesis, and [[wasting syndrome]]. Busulfan also induces [[thrombocytopenia]], a condition of lowered blood [[platelet]] count and activity.  Seizures and VOD are serious concerns with busulfan therapy and prophylaxis is often utilized to avoid these effects.  Hepatic VOD is a dose-limiting toxicity.

Antiemetics are often administered prior to busulfan to prevent emesis.

[[Phenytoin]] may be used concurrently to prevent the seizures. [[Levetiracetam]], has shown efficacy for the prophylaxis against busulfan-induced seizures. Benzodiazepines can also be used for busulfan-induced seizures.

Ursodiol may be considered for prophylaxis of veno-occlusive disease.

Busulfan is listed by the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|IARC]] as a Group 1 [[carcinogen]].

Ten to forty percent of patients will experience nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, itching skin, increased body temperature, trembling and weakness. One to five percent of patients may experience back and chest pain, dizziness, [[anemia]], chills and sweating, metallic taste, [[tachycardia]] and respiratory distress.

Contraindications for the use of carbetocin include inappropriate timing during labor and delivery (such as before parturition or to induce labor) or allergic reactions to carbetocin or other oxytocin homologues. Additionally, carbetocin should not be used if a patient has high blood pressure or cardiovascular problems. Overdosage or repeated use of carbetocin, particularly if used during pregnancy, could cause hyper-excitation of the oxytocin receptors resulting in excessive and prolonged stimulation of uterine contractions, increasing risk of [[uterine rupture]], [[placental abruption]], fetal respiratory distress and [[postpartum hemorrhage]].

Because decozine has mixed agonist/antagonist effects on mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid receptors, it has a lowered [[dependence (behavioral medicine)|dependence]] potential than purely agonistic opiates. It can be prescribed, therefore, in small doses over an extended period of time without causing patients to develop and sustain an [[addiction]]. Its efficacy as an analgesic is dose-dependent; however, it displays a [[ceiling effect (pharmacology)|ceiling effect]] in induced respiratory depression at 0.3-0.4&amp;nbsp;mg/kg.

Side effects at lower doses include mild gastrointestinal discomfort and dizziness. It is often administered in post-operative [[laproscopy]] patients as an alternative to [[fentanyl]].

The most common side effects of enalapril include increased [[serum creatinine]] (20%), dizziness (2–8%), low blood pressure (1–7%), syncope (2%), and dry cough (1–2%). The most serious common adverse event is [[angioedema]] (swelling) (0.68%) which often affects the face and lips, endangering the patient’s airway. Angioedema can occur at any point during treatment with enalapril but is most common after the first few doses. Angioedema and fatality therefrom is reportedly higher among black people.

    <title>Sulfonylurea</title>

Sulfonylureas, as opposed to [[metformin]], the [[thiazolidinedione]]s, [[exenatide]], [[symlin]] and other newer treatment agents may induce [[hypoglycemia]] as a result of excesses in insulin production and release. This typically occurs if the dose is too high, and the patient is fasting. Some people attempt to change eating habits to prevent this, however it can be counter productive.

Like [[insulin]], sulfonylureas can induce weight gain, mainly as a result of their effect to increase insulin levels and thus utilization of glucose and other metabolic fuels. Other side-effects are: gastrointestinal upset, [[headache]] and [[hypersensitivity]] reactions.

The safety of sulfonylurea therapy in pregnancy is unestablished.  Prolonged hypoglycemia (4 to 10 days) has been reported in children borne to mothers taking sulfonylureas at the time of delivery.

Second-generation sulfonylureas have increased potency by weight, compared to first-generation sulfonylureas.  Similarly, ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes) and the VADT (Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial) studies  showed no reduction in heart attack or death in patients assigned to tight glucose control with various drugs.

    <title>Spironolactone</title>

The most common side effect of spironolactone is [[urinary frequency]]. Other general side effects include [[dehydration]], [[hyponatremia]] (low [[sodium]] levels), mild [[hypotension]] (low [[blood pressure]]), [[ataxia]] (muscle incoordination), [[drowsiness]], [[dizziness]], [[dry skin]], and [[rash]]es. Because it reduces androgen levels and directly blocks androgen signaling, spironolactone can, in men, cause [[breast tenderness]], [[gynecomastia]] (male breast development), and [[feminization (biology)|feminization]] in general, as well as [[testicular atrophy]], reversibly [[infertility|reduced fertility]], and [[sexual dysfunction]] including loss of [[libido]] and [[erectile dysfunction]]. Of people prescribed typical dosages of spironolactone, 10 to 15% have been found to develop some degree of hyperkalemia, and 6% have been found to develop severe hyperkalemia. At a higher dosage,&lt;!--75 mg/day--&gt; a rate of hyperkalemia of 24% has been observed.

Although spironolactone poses an important risk of hyperkalemia in the elderly, those with kidney or cardiovascular disease, or those taking medications or supplements which increase circulating potassium levels, the rate of hyperkalemia in young women without such characteristics who have been treated with spironolactone for dermatological conditions has been found not to differ from that of controls.

===Breast effects===
In women, spironolactone is commonly associated with [[mastodynia|breast pain]] and [[mammoplasia|breast enlargement]], Breast enlargement may occur in 26% of women and is described as mild, but at high dosages, up to or exceeding 50% of men may develop gynecomastia. The severity of the gynecomastia varies considerably, but is usually mild. As with women, gynecomastia associated with spironolactone is commonly although inconsistently accompanied by breast tenderness. Gynecomastia induced by spironolactone usually regresses after a few weeks following discontinuation of the medication.

===Menstrual disturbances===
In women, [[menstrual disturbance]]s are common during spironolactone treatment, with 10 to 50% of women experiencing them at moderate doses and almost all experiencing them at a high doses. Most women taking moderate doses of spironolactone develop [[amenorrhea]], and normal [[menstruation]] usually returns within two months of discontinuation. Spironolactone produces an [[irregular menstruation|irregular]], [[anovulation|anovulatory]] pattern of [[menstrual cycle]]s. It is also associated with [[metrorrhagia]] and [[menorrhagia]] (or [[menometrorrhagia]]) in a large percentage of women. It has no [[contraceptive|birth control]] effect. An alternative proposed cause is inhibition of 17α-hydroxylase and hence [[sex steroid]] [[metabolism]] by spironolactone and consequent changes in sex hormone levels.

The menstrual disturbances associated with spironolactone can usually be controlled well by concomitant treatment with an [[oral contraceptive]].

===Infertility===
At high dosages, spironolactone has been associated with [[semen abnormalities]] such as decreased [[sperm count]] and [[sperm motility|motility]] in men.

===Depression===
Increased glucocorticoid activity in the body is associated with [[depression (mood)|depression]]. It should also be used with caution in people with some [[neurological disorders]], [[anuria|no urine production]], [[acute kidney injury]], or significant impairment of [[kidney failure|kidney excretory function]] with risk of hyperkalemia.

===Spironolactone bodies===
[[File:Spironolactone bodies.png|thumb|175px|[[Micrograph]] ([[H&amp;E stain]]) of an [[adrenal gland]] showing spironolactone bodies.]]
Long-term administration of spironolactone gives the [[histologic]] characteristic of spironolactone bodies in the [[adrenal cortex]]. Spironolactone bodies are eosinophilic, round, concentrically laminated cytoplasmic inclusions surrounded by clear halos in preparations stained with hematoxylin and eosin.

===Pregnancy and breastfeeding===
Spironolactone is considered [[Pregnancy Category]] C meaning that it is unclear if it is safe for use during pregnancy. It is able to cross the [[placenta]]. Likewise, it has been found to be present in the breast milk of lactating mothers and, while the effects of spironolactone or its metabolites have not been extensively studied in breastfeeding infants, it is generally recommended that women also not take the medication while [[breast feeding|nursing]]. However, only very small amounts of spironolactone and its metabolite canrenone enter [[breast milk]], and the amount received by an infant during breastfeeding (&lt;0.5% of the mother's dose) is considered to be insignificant.

A study found that spironolactone was not associated with [[teratogen]]icity in the offspring of rats. In accordance, a subsequent study found that partial feminization of the genitalia occurred in the male offspring of rats that received doses of spironolactone that were five times higher than those normally used in humans (200&amp;nbsp;mg/kg per day). Another study found permanent, dose-related reproductive tract abnormalities rat offspring of both sexes at lower doses (50 to 100&amp;nbsp;mg/kg per day).

In practice however, although experience is limited, spironolactone has never been reported to cause observable feminization or any other congenital defects in humans. A case report described a woman who was prescribed spironolactone during pregnancy with triplets and delivered all three (one boy and two girls) healthy; there was no feminization in the boy. In addition, spironolactone has been used at high doses to treat pregnant women with [[Bartter's syndrome]], and none of the infants (three boys, two girls) showed toxicity, including feminization in the male infants. There are similar findings, albeit also limited, for another antiandrogen, cyproterone acetate (prominent genital defects in male rats, but no human  abnormalities (including feminization of male fetuses) at both a low dose of 2&amp;nbsp;mg/day or high doses of 50 to 100&amp;nbsp;mg/day). In any case, spironolactone is nonetheless not recommended during pregnancy due to theoretical concerns relating to feminization of males and also to potential alteration of fetal potassium levels.

 increases serum [[potassium]] levels and can cause [[hyperkalemia]], a very serious condition. Therefore, it is recommended that people using this medication avoid potassium supplements and salt substitutes containing potassium. while canrenone accounts for the remaining approximate 10 to 25%. In spite of the fact that tamoxifen had two orders of magnitude higher affinity for the ER than did spironolactone, the two medications

* With [[phosphodiesterase inhibitors]] (PDE5 inhibitors)
Many men that have PE also suffer from [[erectile dysfunction]] (ED). Treatment for these patients should consider the drug–drug interaction between dapoxetine and PDE5 inhibitors such as [[tadalafil]] (Cialis) or [[sildenafil]] (Viagra). In Dresser study (2006), plasma concentration of 24 subjects was obtained. Half of the sample pool were treated with dapoxetine 60&amp;nbsp;mg + tadalafil 20&amp;nbsp;mg; the other half were treated with dapoxetine 60&amp;nbsp;mg + sildenafil 100&amp;nbsp;mg. These plasma samples were then analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The results showed that dapoxetine does not alter the pharmacokinetic of tadalafil or sildenafil.
* With [[Ethanol|ethano]]l
Ethanol doesn't affect the pharmacokinetics of dapoxetine when taking concurrently.

Side effects associated with ospemifene include vaginal discharge, hot flashes, and diaphoresis. There are other additional adverse effects.

Ospemifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator. As such, many of the effects produced by estrogens are produced by ospemifene. The [[boxed warning]] of the medication indicates ospemifene may thicken the endometrium, which could lead to unusual bleeding and endometrial cancer. For women taking estrogens, concurrently taking a type of drug called a [[progestin]] has been shown to decrease the occurrence of endometrial hyperplasia. In theory, progestins may be expected to attenuate ospemifene's effects on endometrial thickening. However clinical trials confirming this have not been conducted. Like estrogens, ospemifene also may increase the risk for cardiovascular events, including &quot;stroke, coronary heart disease, venous thromboembolism,&quot; and others. The risk of thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes is given as 0.72 and 1.45 per 1,000 women, while that of deep vein thrombosis is estimated to be 1.45 per 1,000 women. The risks of these adverse events in women taking ospemifene are lower than those in women taking estrogen alone. Studies have not documented the relative risk compared with women taking estrogen/progestin therapy.

    <title>Amphotericin B</title>

Amphotericin B is well known for its severe and potentially lethal side effects. Very often, it causes a serious reaction soon after infusion (within 1 to 3 hours), consisting of high fever, shaking chills, [[hypotension]], [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[headache]], [[dyspnea]] and [[tachypnea]], [[drowsiness]], and generalized weakness. The violent chills and fevers have been nicknamed &quot;shake and bake&quot;. This reaction sometimes subsides with later applications of the drug, and may in part be due to histamine liberation. An increase in [[prostaglandin]] synthesis may also play a role. This nearly universal febrile response necessitates a critical (and diagnostically difficult) professional determination as to whether the onset of high fever is a novel symptom of a fast-progressing disease, or merely the effect of the drug. To decrease the likelihood and severity of the symptoms, initial doses should be low, and increased slowly. [[Paracetamol]], [[pethidine]], [[diphenhydramine]], and [[hydrocortisone]] have all been used to treat or prevent the syndrome, but the prophylactic use of these drugs is often limited by the patient's condition.

Intravenously administered amphotericin B in therapeutic doses has also been associated with multiple organ damage. [[Nephrotoxicity|Kidney damage]] is a frequently reported side effect, and can be severe and/or irreversible. Less kidney toxicity has been reported with liposomal formulations (such as AmBisome) and it has become preferred in patients with preexisting renal injury. The integrity of the liposome is disrupted when it binds to the fungal cell wall, but is not affected by the mammalian cell membrane, so the association with liposomes decreases the exposure of the kidneys to amphotericin B, which explains its less nephrotoxic effects.

In addition, electrolyte imbalances such as [[hypokalemia]] and [[hypomagnesemia]] are also common. In the liver, increased liver enzymes and [[hepatotoxicity]] (up to and including [[acute liver failure|fulminant liver failure]]) are common. In the circulatory system, several forms of anemia and other blood dyscrasias ([[leukopenia]], [[thrombopenia]]), serious cardiac [[arrhythmias]] (including [[ventricular fibrillation]]), and even frank [[cardiac failure]] have been reported. Skin reactions, including serious forms, are also possible.

{{See also|Anabolic steroid#Adverse effects}}

[[Adverse effect]]s of methyltestosterone include [[androgen]]ic side effects like [[oily skin]], [[acne]], [[seborrhea]], increased [[facial hair|facial]]/[[body hair]] [[hair growth|growth]], [[pattern hair loss|scalp hair loss]], increased [[aggressiveness]] and [[sex drive]], and [[spontaneous erection]]s, as well as [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]]ic side effects like [[breast tenderness]], [[gynecomastia]], [[water retention (medicine)|fluid retention]], and [[edema]]. In women, methyltestosterone can cause partially irreversible [[virilization]], for instance [[voice deepening]], [[hirsutism]], [[clitoromegaly]], [[breast atrophy]], and [[muscle hypertrophy]], as well as [[menstrual irregularity|menstrual disturbance]]s and reversible [[infertility]]. In men, the drug may also cause [[hypogonadism]], [[testicular atrophy]], and reversible infertility at sufficiently high dosages.

Methyltestosterone can sometimes cause [[hepatotoxicity]], for instance [[elevated liver enzymes]], [[cholestatic jaundice]], [[peliosis hepatis]], [[hepatoma]]s, and [[hepatocellular carcinoma]], with extended use. AAS like methyltestosterone stimulate [[erythropoiesis]] ([[red blood cell]] production) and increase [[hematocrit]] levels and at high dosages can cause [[polycythemia]] (overproduction of red blood cells), which can greatly increase the risk of [[thrombosis|thrombic]] events such as [[embolism]] and [[stroke]]. With long-term treatment, AAS can increase the risk of [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]] and [[prostate cancer]]. [[Violence|Violent]] and even [[homicide|homicidal behavior]], [[hypomania]]/[[mania]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[suicidality]], [[delusion]]s, and [[psychosis]] have all been associated with very high dosages of AAS.

    <title>Cocaine</title>

===Acute===
{{Main article|Cocaine intoxication}}
With excessive or prolonged use, the drug can cause [[itch]]ing, [[tachycardia|fast heart rate]], [[hallucination]]s, and [[formication|paranoid delusions]]. [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]]s,

Anxiety, [[paranoia]], and restlessness can also occur, especially during the comedown. With excessive dosage, tremors, convulsions and increased body temperature are observed. Severe cardiac adverse events, particularly [[sudden cardiac death]], become a serious risk at high doses due to cocaine's blocking effect on cardiac sodium channels.
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:US timeline. Cocaine deaths.jpg|thumb|Timeline of number of yearly U.S. overdose deaths involving cocaine.
File:Rational harm assessment of drugs radar plot.svg|thumb|[[Delphi method|Delphic analysis]] regarding 20 popular recreational drugs based on expert opinion. Cocaine was ranked the 2nd in dependence and physical harm and 3rd in social harm.

Physical side effects from chronic smoking of cocaine include [[hemoptysis|coughing up blood]], [[bronchospasm]], [[pruritus|itching]], [[fever]], diffuse alveolar infiltrates without effusions, pulmonary and systemic [[eosinophilia]], chest pain, lung trauma, sore throat, [[asthma]], hoarse voice, [[dyspnea]] (shortness of breath), and an aching, [[flu]]-like syndrome. Cocaine [[Vasoconstriction|constricts blood vessels]], [[Mydriasis|dilates pupils]], and increases body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. It can also cause headaches and gastrointestinal complications such as abdominal pain and nausea. A common but untrue belief is that the smoking of cocaine chemically breaks down [[tooth enamel]] and causes [[tooth decay]]. However, cocaine does often cause involuntary tooth grinding, known as [[bruxism]], which can deteriorate tooth enamel and lead to [[gingivitis]]. Additionally, stimulants like cocaine, methamphetamine, and even caffeine cause dehydration and [[Xerostomia|dry mouth]]. Since saliva is an important mechanism in maintaining one's oral pH level, chronic stimulant abusers who do not hydrate sufficiently may experience demineralization of their teeth due to the pH of the tooth surface dropping too low (below 5.5). Cocaine use also promotes the [[thrombosis|formation of blood clots]]. This increase in blood clot formation is attributed to cocaine-associated increases in the activity of [[Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1|plasminogen activator inhibitor]], and an increase in the number, activation, and aggregation of [[platelet]]s.

Chronic intranasal usage can degrade the [[cartilage]] separating the [[nostrils]] (the [[septum nasi]]), leading eventually to its complete disappearance. Due to the absorption of the cocaine from cocaine hydrochloride, the remaining hydrochloride forms a dilute hydrochloric acid. Cocaine use also increases the risk of having a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]].

===Addiction===
{{see also|Epigenetics of cocaine addiction}}
[[Cocaine addiction]] occurs through [[ΔFosB]] overexpression in the [[nucleus accumbens]], which results in altered [[transcriptional regulation]] in neurons within the [[nucleus accumbens]].

ΔFosB levels have been found to increase upon the use of cocaine. Each subsequent dose of cocaine continues to increase ΔFosB levels with no ceiling of tolerance. Elevated levels of ΔFosB leads to increases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor ([[BDNF]]) levels, which in turn increases the number of [[dendrite|dendritic]] branches and [[dendritic spine|spines]] present on neurons involved with the nucleus accumbens and [[prefrontal cortex]] areas of the brain. This change can be identified rather quickly, and may be sustained weeks after the last dose of the drug.

Transgenic mice exhibiting inducible expression of ΔFosB primarily in the nucleus accumbens and [[dorsal striatum]] exhibit [[drug sensitization|sensitized]] behavioural responses to cocaine. They self-administer cocaine at lower doses than control, but have a greater likelihood of [[relapse]] when the drug is withheld. ΔFosB increases the expression of [[AMPA receptor]] subunit GluR2 and also decreases expression of [[dynorphin]], thereby enhancing sensitivity to reward.

===Dependence and withdrawal===
[[Cocaine dependence]] is a form of [[psychological dependence]] that develops from regular cocaine use and produces a [[drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] state with emotional-motivational deficits upon cessation of cocaine use.

Bortezomib is associated with [[peripheral neuropathy]] in 30% of patients; occasionally, it can be painful.  This can be worse in patients with pre-existing [[neuropathy]]. In addition, [[myelosuppression]] causing [[neutropenia]] and [[thrombocytopenia]] can also occur and be dose-limiting. However, these [[side effects]] are usually mild relative to [[bone marrow transplantation]] and other treatment options for patients with advanced disease. Bortezomib is associated with a high rate of [[shingles]], although [[Prophylaxis|prophylactic]] [[acyclovir]] can reduce the risk of this.
Acute interstitial nephritis has also been reported.

[[Gastrointestinal tract|Gastro-intestinal]] (GI) effects and [[asthenia]] are the most common adverse events.

Propylthiouracil is generally well tolerated, with side effects occurring in one of every 100 patients.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The most common side effects are related to the skin, and include rash, itching, hives, abnormal hair loss, and skin pigmentation.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Other common side effects are swelling, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, loss of taste, joint or muscle aches, numbness and headache, allergic reactions, and hair whitening.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Its notable side effects include a risk of [[agranulocytosis]] and [[aplastic anemia]]. On 3 June 2009, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|FDA]] published an alert &quot;notifying healthcare professionals of the risk of serious liver injury, including liver failure and death, with the use of propylthiouracil.&quot; As a result, propylthiouracil is no longer recommended in non-pregnant adults and in children as the front line antithyroid medication.

One possible side effect is [[agranulocytosis]],

The primary effect on the fetus from transplacental passage of PTU is the production of a mild hypothyroidism when the drug is used close to term.  This usually resolves within a few days without treatment.  The hypothyroid state may be observed as a goiter in the newborn, and is the result of increased levels of fetal pituitary thyrotropin.  The incidence of fetal goiter after PTU treatment in reported cases is approximately 12%.

Additionally, it can also be associated with a [[coagulopathy]] as it decreases protein synthesis, including synthesis of coagulation factors (e.g. progressive isolated decrease of [[fibrinogen]]) and anticoagulant factor (generally [[antithrombin]] III; sometimes [[protein C]] &amp; [[protein S|S]] as well), leading to [[bleeding]] or [[Blood clotting|thrombotic events]] such as stroke.

    <title>Gentamicin</title>

Adverse effects of gentamicin can range from less severe reactions such as nausea and vomiting to more severe reactions such as:
* Low blood counts
* [[Hypersensitivity|Allergic responses]] 
* [[Neuromuscular disease|Neuromuscular]] problems
* [[neuropathy|Nerve damage]] 
* [[Nephrotoxicity|Kidney damage (nephrotoxicity)]]
* [[Ototoxicity|Ear disorders (ototoxicity)]]
[[Nephrotoxicity]] and [[ototoxicity]] are thought to be dose related with higher doses causing greater chance of toxicity. These two toxicities may have delayed presentation, sometimes not appearing until after completing treatment.

=== Kidney damage ===
[[Nephrotoxicity|Kidney damage]] is a problem in 10-25% of people who receive aminoglycosides, and gentamicin is one of the most nephrotoxic of the class. Oftentimes acute nephrotoxicity is reversible, but it may be fatal. The risk of nephrotoxicity can be affected by the dose, frequency, duration of therapy, and concurrent use of certain medications such as NSAIDs, diuretics, cisplatin, ciclosporin, cephalosporin, amphotericin, iodide contrast media, and vancomycin.

Factors that increase risk of nephrotoxicity include:
* Increased age
* Reduced renal function
* Pregnancy
* Hypothyroidism
* Hepatic dysfunction
* Volume depletion
* Metabolic acidosis
* Sodium depletion
Kidney dysfunction is monitored by measuring [[creatinine]] in the blood, electrolyte levels, [[Oliguria|low urine output]], [[Proteinuria|foamy urine]],  and concentrations of other chemicals in the blood. Chronic use of gentamicin can affect two areas of the ears. First, damage of the inner ear hair cells can result in irreversible hearing loss. Second, damage to inner ear [[Vestibular system|vestibular]] apparatus can lead to balance problems.

Factors that increase risk of inner ear damage include:
* [[Uremia|High blood uric acid levels]]
* Kidney dysfunction  
* Liver dysfunction 
* Higher doses 
* Long courses of therapy
* Elderly
* Also taking strong diuretics (e.g. [[furosemide]])

* [[QT interval|QTc interval prolongation]] (has a relatively low risk for causing QTc interval prolongation. Its potential for elevating plasma prolactin levels seems relatively limited too according to this meta-analysis. This meta-analysis also found that asenapine has approximately the same odds ratio (3.28; 95% CI: 1.37-6.69) for causing sedation [compared to placebo-treated patients] as [[olanzapine]] (3.34; 95% CI: 2.46-4.50]) and [[haloperidol]] (2.76; 95% CI: 2.04-3.66) and a higher odds ratio (although not ''significantly'') for sedation than [[aripiprazole]] (1.84; 95% CI: 1.05-3.05), [[paliperidone]] (1.40; 95% CI: 0.85-2.19) and [[amisulpride]] (1.42; 95% CI: 0.72 to 2.51) to name a few and is hence a mild-moderately sedating antipsychotic.

* [[hyponatraemia]], [[hypokalaemia]], [[hypercalcaemia]]
* [[gout]]
* impaired glucose tolerance
* [[impotence]]
* [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]]

Rare adverse effects:

* [[thrombocytopenia]]
* [[agranulocytosis]]
* [[photodermatitis|photosensitivity rash]]
* [[pancreatitis]]
* [[renal insufficiency]]

=== Alcohol ===
Bendroflumethiazide is known to have an adverse interaction with alcohol. It is advised that those using this diuretic should abstain from alcohol consumption during use, as it is possible to experience a sudden drop in blood pressure, especially if standing up (an effect known as [[postural hypotension]]).

=== Other considerations ===
Bendroflumethiazide should not be used by pregnant women, or women who have just given birth. Due to the nature of the medication, it is possible for it to pass into the breast milk and consequently to the child. It is also known that bendroflumethiazide suppresses the production of breast milk. Pregnant or lactating women with hypertension may need to discuss with their prescriber as to which alternative treatment may be more suitable. Bendroflumethiazide may also impair the user's motor skills, therefore it is important to be aware of its effects and to take caution when operating machinery of driving.

    <title>Gemcitabine</title>

Gemcitabine is a [[chemotherapy]] drug that works by killing any cells that are dividing. Cancer cells divide rapidly and so are targeted at higher rates by gemcitabine, but many essential cells divide rapidly as well, including cells in skin, the scalp, the lining of the stomach, and bone marrow, resulting in adverse effects.{{rp|265}}

The gemcitabine label carries warnings that it can suppress bone marrow function and cause [[leukopenia|loss of white blood cells]], [[thrombocytopenia|loss of platelets]], and [[anaemia|loss of red blood cells]], that it should be used carefully in people with liver, kidney, or cardiovascular disorders, that people taking it should not take live vaccines, that it may cause [[posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome]], that it may cause [[capillary leak syndrome]], that it may cause severe lung conditions like [[pulmonary edema]], [[pneumonia]], and [[adult respiratory distress syndrome]], and that it may harm sperm.

Very common (more than 10% of people develop them) adverse effects include difficulty breathing, low white and red blood cells counts and low platelet counts, vomiting and nausea, [[elevated transaminases]], rashes and itchy skin, hair loss, blood and protein in urine, flu-like symptoms, and edema.

    <title>Naltrexone</title>

The most common side effects reported with naltrexone are [[gastrointestinal]] complaints such as [[diarrhea]] and abdominal cramping. These adverse effects are analogous to the symptoms of [[opioid withdrawal]], as the mu receptor blockade will increase GI motility.

Naltrexone has been reported to cause liver damage (when given at doses higher than recommended). It carries an FDA boxed warning for this rare side effect. Due to these reports, some physicians may check liver function tests prior to starting naltrexone, and periodically thereafter. Concerns for liver toxicity initially arose from a study of non-addicted obese patients receiving 300&amp;nbsp;mg of naltrexone. Subsequent studies have suggested limited toxicity in other patient populations.

Naltrexone should not be started until several (typically 7-10) days of abstinence from opioids has been achieved. This is due to the risk of acute opioid withdrawal if naltrexone is taken, as naltrexone will displace most opioids from their receptors. The time of abstinence may be shorter than 7 days, depending on the half-life of the specific opioid taken. Some physicians use a naloxone challenge to determine whether an individual has any opioids remaining. The challenge involves giving a test dose of naloxone and monitoring for opioid withdrawal. If withdrawal occurs, naltrexone should not be started.

As with all SGLT-2 inhibitors, canagliflozin is associated with increased incidence of urinary tract infections, fungal infections of the genital area, thirst,

On May 15, 2015, the FDA issued a warning that certain SGLT2 diabetes drugs, including canagliflozin, may lead to ketoacidosis, a condition where the body produces higher levels of ketone bodies. The FDA is continuing to investigate the issue, and cautions that patients should not stop taking canagliflozin without first talking to their doctor.

On September 10, 2015, the FDA issued a drug safety communication for canagliflozin to address risks for bone fracture and decreased bone density. A label warning for fractures was already included in the ''Adverse Reactions'' section; however, the FDA made the addition to the ''Warnings and Precautions'' section to reflect new information from a placebo study. They advised health care professionals should consider fracture risk factors before prescribing canagliflozin, and patients should disclose any bone fracture risk factors to their doctors, but that patients should not stop taking the medication without first talking to their doctor.

On December 4, 2015, the FDA issued another safety communication for SGLT2 inhibitors, indicating that it would require new warnings to be added to the canagliflozin label about elevated blood acid levels and urinary tract infections.

A June 29, 2016 report on the ongoing cardiovascular outcomes trial for canagliflozin (CANVAS) revealed interim findings of new safety concerns including heightened risk of bone fracture that was found to increase with the duration of treatment.

On May 16, 2017, the FDA concluded that canagliflozin causes an increased risk of leg and foot amputations. The FDA began requiring a [[boxed warning]] to be added to the canagliflozin drug labels to describe this risk.

    <title>Tranylcypromine</title>

'''&lt;big&gt;Incidence of adverse effects&lt;/big&gt;'''

Tranylcypromine is not associated with [[weight gain]] and has a low risk for hepatotoxicity compared to the [[hydrazine (Antidepressant)|hydrazine]] MAOIs.

It is generally recommended that MAOIs be discontinued prior to [[anesthesia]]; however, this creates a risk of recurrent depression. In a retrospective observational cohort study, patients on tranylcypromine undergoing general anesthesia had a lower incidence of intraoperative hypotension, while there was no difference between patients not taking an MAOI regarding intraoperative incidence of bradycardia, tachycardia, or hypertension. The use of indirect [[sympathomimetic drug]]s or drugs affecting serotonin reuptake, such as [[meperidine]] or [[dextromethorphan]] poses a risk for [[hypertension]] and [[serotonin syndrome]] respectively; alternative agents are recommended. Other studies have come to similar conclusions. Pharmacokinetic interactions with anesthetics are unlikely, given that tranylcypromine is a high-affinity substrate for [[CYP2A6]] and does not inhibit CYP enzymes at therapeutic concentrations.

Tranylcypromine [[substance abuse|abuse]] has been reported at doses ranging from 120–600&amp;nbsp;mg per day. It is thought that higher doses have more [[amphetamine]]-like effects and abuse is promoted by the fast onset and short half-life of tranylcypromine.

Cases of suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviours have been reported during tranylcypromine therapy or early after treatment discontinuation.

Symptoms of tranylcypromine overdose are generally more intense manifestations of its usual effects.

Over 10% of oral sotalol users experience [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[dizziness]], [[lightheadedness]], [[headache]], [[asthenia|weakness]], [[nausea]], [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]], [[bradycardia]] (slow heart rate), [[palpitation|a sensation of the heart beating too hard, fast, or irregularly]], or [[chest pain]]. Higher doses of sotalol increase the risk for all of these possible side effects. For patients who had a history of [[sustained ventricular tachycardia]] (abnormal rhythm lasting more than 30 seconds), 4% developed TdP. Risk increases with dosage, female sex, or having a history of an [[cardiomegaly|enlarged heart]] or [[congestive heart failure]]. The [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of TdP for sustained ventricular tachycardia patients was 0% with an 80&amp;nbsp;mg daily dose, 0.5% at 160&amp;nbsp;mg, 1.6% at 320&amp;nbsp;mg, 4.4% at 480&amp;nbsp;mg, 3.7% at 640&amp;nbsp;mg, and 5.8% at doses greater than 640&amp;nbsp;mg. Due to this risk, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires affected individuals to be hospitalized for at least three days in a facility that can provide cardiac resuscitation and continuous electrocardiographic monitoring upon starting or restarting sotalol.

Overall, trastuzumab emtansine was better tolerated than the control treatment, a combination of [[lapatinib]] (Tykerb) and [[capecitabine]] (Xeloda), with 43% of patients in the trastuzumab emtansine group experiencing severe toxic effects, versus 59% of those who received lapatinib/capecitabine; furthermore, fewer patients had to stop treatment due to adverse effects than with lapatinib or capecitabine. [[Anemia]], low platelet counts, and peripheral neuropathy were more common among patients who received trastuzumab emtansine, whereas heart damage and gastrointestinal effects, such as vomiting, diarrhea, and [[stomatitis]], were more common with lapatinib/capecitabine.

Most common side-effects include nausea, vomiting, acid reflux (heartburn), headache, cosmetic reduction in abdominal body fat, light sleeping, and loss of appetite. Less common side effects include faint discoloration of fingernails and toenails, mood elevation, occasional tingling or transient numbness of the hands or feet, and minor skin discoloration. Allergic reactions are rare.

Early long-term higher-dose therapy with AZT was initially associated with side effects that sometimes limited therapy, including [[anemia]], [[neutropenia]], [[hepatotoxicity]], [[cardiomyopathy]], and [[myopathy]]. All of these conditions were generally found to be reversible upon reduction of AZT dosages. They have been attributed to several possible causes, including transient depletion of [[mitochondrial DNA]], sensitivity of the γ-DNA polymerase in some cell [[mitochondria]], the depletion of [[thymidine triphosphate]], [[oxidative stress]], reduction of intracellular &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-[[carnitine]] or [[apoptosis]] of the muscle cells. Anemia due to AZT was successfully treated using [[Erythropoietin|erythropoetin]] to stimulate [[red blood cell]] production. Drugs that inhibit [[liver|hepatic]] [[glucuronidation]], such as [[indomethacin]], [[nordazepam]], [[acetylsalicylic acid]] (aspirin) and [[trimethoprim]] decreased the elimination rate and increased the therapeutic strength of the medication. Today, side-effects are much less common with the use of lower doses of AZT.
According to IARC, there is sufficient evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of zidovudine; it is possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B).

===Viral resistance===
Even at the highest doses that can be tolerated in patients, AZT is not potent enough to prevent all HIV replication and may only slow the replication of the virus and progression of the disease. Prolonged AZT treatment can lead to HIV developing resistance to AZT by [[mutation]] of its [[reverse transcriptase]]. To slow the development of resistance, physicians generally recommend that AZT be given in combination with another [[Reverse transcriptase inhibitor#Nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NARTIs or NRTIs)|reverse transcriptase inhibitor]] and an antiretroviral from another group, such as a [[Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease inhibitor]], [[Reverse transcriptase inhibitor#Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)|non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor]], or [[integrase inhibitor]]; this type of therapy is known as [[HAART]] (Highly Active Anti Retroviral Therapy).

Salicylates displace tolbutamide from its binding site on plasma binding proteins which lead to increase in free tolbutamide concentration, thus hypoglycemic shock.

    <title>Simvastatin</title>

Common side effects (&gt;1% incidence) may include indigestion and eczema. Rare side effects include joint pain, memory loss, and muscle cramps. Cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic cirrhosis, rhabdomyolysis (destruction of muscles and blockade of renal system), and myositis have been reported in patients receiving the drug chronically. Serious allergic reactions to simvastatin are rare.

A type of [[DNA]] variant known as a [[single nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) may help predict individuals prone to developing [[myopathy]] when taking simvastatin; a study ultimately including 32,000 patients concluded the carriers of one or two risk [[allele]]s of a particular SNP, rs4149056, were at a five-fold or 16-fold increased risk, respectively. In 2012, the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium has released guidelines regarding the use of rs4149056 genotype in guiding dosing of simvastatin and updated the guideline in 2014.

In March 2012, the FDA updated its guidance for statin users to address reports of memory loss, liver damage, increased blood sugar, development of [[type 2 diabetes]], and muscle injury. The new guidance indicates:
* FDA has found that liver injury associated with statin use is rare but can occur.
* The reports about memory loss, forgetfulness, and confusion span all statin products and all age groups. The FDA says these experiences are rare but that those affected often report feeling “fuzzy” or unfocused in their thinking.
* A small increased risk of raised blood sugar levels and the development of type 2 diabetes have been reported with the use of statins.
* Some drugs interact with statins in a way that increases the risk of muscle injury called myopathy, characterized by unexplained muscle weakness or pain.

On March 19, 2010, the FDA issued another statement regarding simvastatin, saying it increases the risk of muscle injury ([[myopathy]]) when taken at high doses or at lower doses in combination with other drugs. The highest dose rate causes muscle damage in 610 of every 10,000 people in contrast to a lower dose, which causes muscle damage in eight of 10,000 people. The FDA warning, released again on June 8, 2011, suggested that high dose &quot;simvastatin should be used only in patients who have been taking this dose for 12 months or more without evidence of muscle injury&quot; and that it &quot;should not be started in new patients, including patients already taking lower doses of the drug.&quot;

Lovastatin is usually well tolerated, with the most common side effects being, in approximately descending order of frequency: [[creatine phosphokinase]] elevation, [[flatulence]], abdominal pain, constipation, [[diarrhoea]], [[myalgia|muscle aches or pains]], nausea, [[dyspepsia|indigestion]], weakness, blurred vision, rash, dizziness and muscle cramps. This can be life-threatening if not recognised and treated in time, so any unexplained muscle pain or weakness whilst on lovastatin should be promptly mentioned to the prescribing doctor. Other uncommon side effects that should be promptly mentioned to either the prescribing doctor or an emergency medical service include:
{{columns-list|2|
*constipation
*memory loss or forgetfulness
*confusion}}

===Contraindications===
[[Contraindication]]s, conditions that warrant withholding treatment with lovastatin, include pregnancy, breast feeding, and liver disease. Lovastatin is contraindicated during pregnancy (Pregnancy Category X); it may cause birth defects such as skeletal deformities or learning disabilities. Due to its potential to disrupt infant lipid metabolism, lovastatin should not be taken while breastfeeding. Patients with liver disease should not take lovastatin.

===Interactions===
As with [[atorvastatin]], [[simvastatin]], and other statin drugs metabolized via [[CYP3A4]], drinking [[grapefruit]] juice during lovastatin therapy may increase the risk of side effects. Components of grapefruit juice, the [[flavonoid]] [[naringin]], or the [[furanocoumarin]] [[bergamottin]] inhibit CYP3A4 ''in vitro'', and may account for the ''in vivo'' effect of grapefruit juice concentrate decreasing the metabolic clearance of lovastatin, and increasing its plasma concentrations.

Siltuximab may lower resistance to infections and should not be administered to patients with severe infections. Siltuximab should be discontinued in patients with severe infusion related reactions, anaphylaxis, severe allergic reactions or cytokine release syndromes. Live vaccines should not be administered to patients receiving siltuximab since IL-6 inhibition may interfere with normal immune response to new antigens.

    <title>Lormetazepam</title>

Side effects of lormetazepam are similar to those of other hypnotic benzodiazepines and can for the most part be regarded as a class effect. In a sleep study, 1&amp;nbsp;mg lormetazepam increased total sleep time, reduced wakefulness, but did not alter [[REM sleep]]. However, at 2&amp;nbsp;mg doses, there were significant increases in stage 3 sleep and reductions in REM sleep. [[Rebound effect]]s have been reported after chronic use including rebound REM. In one clinical trial with patients who had prior experience with older hypnotics [[temazepam]] and [[nitrazepam]], most preferred lormetazepam due to less heavy sedation, amnesia, and residual effects. Some side effects, including drowsiness, [[amnesia]], and respiratory depression, are increased when lormetazepam is combined with other drugs with similar effects, e.g. [[alcohol]] and [[nonbenzodiazepine]] drugs.

Although lormetazepam has been associated with adversely affecting immediate and delayed recall memory functions, studies have shown that lormetazepam's amnesic properties may be lesser compared to other hypnotic benzodiazepines. For example, in a 1984 study comparing the amnesic effects of lormetazepam to temazepam and flurazepam showed that amnesia was smallest after lormetazepam and greatest after temazepam, which had produced greater amnesia than both lormetazepam and flurazepam by a significant margin.

Side effects of lormetazepam include:

*[[somnolence]]
*paradoxical increase in aggression
*[[lightheadedness]]
*[[confusion]]
*muscle weakness
*[[ataxia]] (particularly in the elderly)
*[[anterograde amnesia]]
*[[headache]]
*[[vertigo (medical)|vertigo]]
*[[hypotension]]
*salivation changes

*[[tremor]]
*changes in [[libido]]
*[[urinary incontinence|incontinence]]
*[[urinary retention]]
*[[blood disorder]]s and [[jaundice]]
*[[skin]] reactions
*dependence and withdrawal reactions

Residual &quot;hangover&quot; effects after nighttime administration of lormetazepam such as sleepiness, impaired psychomotor and [[cognitive]] functions may persist into the next day which may impair the ability of users to drive safely and increase risks of falls and [[hip fracture]]s.

    <title>Diazoxide</title>

{{Refimprove|date = July 2015}}

Diazoxide interferes with insulin release through its action on potassium channels. Diazoxide is one of the most potent openers of the K+ ATP channels present on the insulin producing beta cells of the pancreas. Opening these channels leads to hyperpolarization of cell membrane, a decrease in calcium influx, and a subsequently reduced release of insulin. This mechanism of action is the mirror opposite of that of [[sulfonylurea]]s, a class of medications used to increase insulin release in [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type 2 Diabetics]]. Therefore, this medicine is not given to non-insulin dependent diabetic patients.

The [[USFDA|Food and Drug Administration]] published a Safety Announcement in July 2015 highlighting the potential for development of [[pulmonary hypertension]] in newborns and infants treated with this drug.

In clinical trials of the three-agent combination therapy in metastatic breast cancer, adverse effects occurring in more than half the people taking it included diarrhea, hair loss, and [[neutropenia|loss of neutrophils]]; more than 10% of people experienced loss of neutrophils with fever, and [[leucopenia|loss of leukocytes]].  After docetaxel was dropped in some people, the most common adverse effects were diarrhea (28.1%), upper respiratory tract infection (18.3%), rash (18.3%), headache (17.0%), fatigue (13.4%), swelling of nasal passages and throat (often due to catching the common cold) (17.0%), weakness (13.4%), itchiness (13.7%), joint pain (11.4%), nausea (12.7%), pain in an extremity (13.4%), back pain (12.1%) and cough (12.1%).

In clinical trials of the neoadjuvant use of the combination, more than 50% of people had hair loss and [[neutropenia|loss of neutrophils]].

In both uses, more than 10% of people additionally experienced: [[anemia|loss of red blood cells]], hypersensitivity or allergic reaction, infusion reactions, decreased appetite, insomnia, distortions in the sense of taste, inflammation of the mouth or lips, constipation, rashes, [[nail disease]], and muscle pain.

    <title>Chloramphenicol</title>


===Aplastic anemia===

The most serious [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]] of chloramphenicol treatment is [[aplastic anaemia]]. This effect is rare and sometimes fatal. The risk of AA is high enough that alternatives should be strongly considered. Treatments are available but expensive. No way exists to predict who may or may not get this side effect.  The effect usually occurs weeks or months after treatment has been stopped, and a genetic predisposition may be involved.  It is not known whether monitoring the [[blood count]]s of patients can prevent the development of aplastic anaemia, but patients are recommended to have a baseline blood count with a repeat blood count every few days while on treatment. Chloramphenicol should be discontinued if the complete blood count drops.  The highest risk is with oral chloramphenicol (affecting 1 in 24,000–40,000) and the lowest risk occurs with eye drops (affecting less than one in 224,716 prescriptions).

[[Thiamphenicol]], a related compound with a similar spectrum of activity, is available in Italy and China for human use, and has never been associated with aplastic anaemia.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}  Thiamphenicol is available in the U.S. and Europe as a [[veterinary]] antibiotic, but is not approved for use in humans.

===Bone marrow suppression===
Chloramphenicol may cause [[bone marrow suppression]] during treatment; this is a direct toxic effect of the drug on human [[mitochondria]].

    <title>Finasteride</title>

A 2010 Cochrane review concluded that adverse effects from finasteride are rare when used for BPH. A 2017 review of men with BPH found that finasteride resulted in a 45% greater likelihood of erectile dysfunction and 54% more hypoactive sexual desire. 

The FDA has added a warning to 5α-reductase inhibitors concerning an increased risk of high-grade [[prostate cancer]], as the treatment of BPH lowers PSA ([[prostate-specific antigen]]), which could mask the development of prostate cancer.

Some men develop breast enlargement ([[gynecomastia]]) following finasteride usage and this can be a source of psychological distress.  Whether finasteride causes long-term sexual dysfunction in some men after stopping drug treatment is unclear. There are [[case reports]] of persistent diminished libido or erectile dysfunction after stopping the drug and the FDA has updated the label to inform people of these reports. In many people these side effects resolve if the medication is stopped and occasionally resolve even if the medication is continued. They additionally state &quot;the sexual functioning questionnaire seems to have given a sensitive reflection of the disturbance on sexual functioning&quot;. Another 2010 review found that when used for hair loss finasteride increased rates of sexual problems.

In men with prostatic hyperplasia the use of both a 5α-reductase inhibitor and a [[alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-adrenergic receptor]] [[alpha blocker|blocker]] resulted in a greater risk of erectile dysfunction compared to either agent alone.

Rarely, the inhibition of [[carbonic anhydrase]] may be strong enough to cause [[metabolic acidosis]] of clinical importance.

The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has notified prescribers that topiramate can cause acute [[myopia]] and secondary angle closure [[glaucoma]] in a small subset of people who take topiramate regularly. The symptoms, which typically begin in the first month of use, include blurred vision and eye pain. Discontinuation of topiramate may halt the progression of the ocular damage, and may reverse the visual impairment.

Preliminary data suggests that, as with several other anti-epileptic drugs, topiramate carries an increased risk of congenital malformations. This might be particularly important for women who take topiramate to prevent migraine attacks. In March 2011 the FDA notified healthcare professionals and patients of an increased risk of development of [[cleft lip]] and/or [[cleft palate]] (oral clefts) in infants born to women treated with Topamax (topiramate) during pregnancy and placed it in [[Pregnancy category|Pregnancy Category]] D.

Topiramate has been associated with a [[statistical significance|statistically significant]] increase in [[suicide|suicidality]], and &quot;suicidal thoughts or actions&quot; is now listed as one of the possible side effects of the drug &quot;in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500.&quot;

    <title>Carprofen</title>

Most dogs respond well to carprofen use, but like all NSAIDs, it may cause gastrointestinal, liver and kidney problems in some patients.

After introduction, significant anecdotal reports of sudden animal deaths from its use arose. To date {{when|date=September 2016}}, the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] has received more than 6,000 adverse reaction reports about the drug (manufactured by [[Pfizer]]). As a result, the FDA requested that Pfizer advise consumers in their advertising that death is a possible side effect. Pfizer refused and pulled their advertising; however, they now include death as a possible side effect on the drug label. Plans call for a &quot;Dear Doctor&quot; letter to advise veterinarians, and a safety sheet attached to pill packages.

Adverse effects include:
* Loss of appetite
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Increase in thirst
* Increase in urination
* Fatigue and/or lethargy ([[drowsiness]])
* Loss of coordination
* Seizures
* Liver dysfunction: [[jaundice]] (yellowing of eyes)
* Blood or dark tar-like material in [[urine]] or [[faeces|stools]]
* [[Lethargy]].
* Staggering, stumbling, weakness or partial [[paralysis]], full paralysis.
* Change in [[skin]] (redness, scabs, or scratching)
* Change in behavior (such as decreased or increased activity level, [[seizure]] or aggression).

Effects of overdose include [[gastritis]] and ulcer formation. 

In healthy dogs given carprofen, no perioperative adverse effects on the cardiovascular system have been reported at recommended
dosages. 
Perioperative administration of carprofen to cats did not effect postoperative respiratory rate nor heart rate.

Carprofen should not be administered concurrently with steroids, as this can cause ulcers in the stomach. Dogs should be taken off carprofen for three full days before ingesting a steroid (such as [[prednisolone]]). Carprofen should not be given at the same time with other types of medications such as other [[NSAID]]s ([[aspirin]], [[etodolac]], [[deracoxib]], [[meloxicam]], [[tepoxalin]]) or [[steroids]] such as [[dexamethasone]], [[triamcinolone]], [[cortisone]] or [[prednisone]].

Carprofen must be used with caution within the supervision of a veterinarian in dogs with liver or kidney disease, [[dehydration]], bleeding deficits, or other health problems. It is not recommended for use in dogs with bleeding disorders (such as [[Von Willebrand's disease]]), as safety has not been established in dogs with these disorders. It has not been established whether carprofen can be safely used in pregnant dogs, dogs used for breeding purposes,  or in lactating female dogs.

Several laboratory studies and clinical trials have been conducted to establish the safety of using Carprofen. Clinical studies were conducted in nearly 300 dogs, coming from different [[breeds]]. The dogs were treated with Rimadyl at the recommended dose for 2 weeks. According to these studies, the drug was clinically well tolerated and the treated dogs did not have a greater incidence of adverse reactions when compared to the control group.

A number of factors that may contribute to the high incidence of adverse reports received for carprofen by the Center for Veterinary Medicine in the late 1990s. These include:
* The type of drug;
* Wide use;
* Duration of use. While the side effects from carprofen are known to occur within a short period of time after administration, it is believed that long-term use may actually result in a higher risk for adverse reactions{{CN|date=January 2017}};
* Senior dog use. Older dogs are generally more prone to side effects caused by carprofen.

{{see also|Hypervitaminosis A}}
The [[Dietary Reference Intake|Tolerable Upper Intake Level]] (UL) for vitamin A, for a 25-year-old male, is 3,000 micrograms/day, or about 10,000 IU.

Too much vitamin A in retinoid form can be harmful or fatal, resulting in what is known as [[hypervitaminosis A]]. The body converts the dimerized form, [[carotene]], into vitamin A as it is needed, therefore high levels of carotene are not toxic compared to the ester (animal) forms. The livers of certain animals, especially those adapted to polar environments such as polar bears and seals, often contain amounts of vitamin A that would be toxic to humans. Thus, vitamin A toxicity is typically reported in Arctic explorers and people taking large doses of synthetic vitamin A. The first documented death possibly caused by vitamin A poisoning was [[Xavier Mertz]], a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] scientist who died in January 1913 on an [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] expedition that had lost its food supplies and fell to eating its sled dogs. Mertz may have consumed lethal amounts of vitamin A by eating the dogs' livers.

Vitamin A acute toxicity occurs when an individual ingests vitamin A in large amounts more than the daily recommended value in the threshold of 25,000 IU/kg or more. Often, the individual consumes about 3–4 times the RDA's specification. Toxicity of vitamin A is believed to be associated with the intervention methods used to upgrade vitamin A levels in the body such as food modification, fortification and supplementation, all of which are employed to combat vitamin A deficiency Toxicity is classified into two categories: acute and chronic toxicities. The former occurs few hours or days after ingestion of large amounts of vitamin A accidentally or via inappropriate therapy. The later toxicity (Chronic) takes place when about 4,000 IU/kg or more of vitamin A is consumed for a prolonged period of time. Symptoms associated with both toxicities include nausea, blurred vision, fatigue, weight-loss, menstrual abnormalities etc.

Excess vitamin A has also been suspected to be a contributor to [[osteoporosis]]. This seems to happen at much lower doses than those required to induce acute intoxication. Only preformed vitamin A can cause these problems, because the conversion of carotenoids into vitamin A is downregulated when physiological requirements are met. An excessive uptake of carotenoids can, however, cause [[carotenosis]].

Dietary supplementation with β-carotene was interestingly associated with an increase in [[lung cancer]] when it was studied in a lung cancer prevention trial in male smokers. In non-smokers, the opposite effect has been noted.

Excess preformed vitamin A during early pregnancy has also been associated with a significant increase in birth defects. These defects may be severe, even life-threatening. Even twice the daily recommended amount can cause severe birth defects. The FDA currently recommends that pregnant women get their vitamin A from foods containing β-carotene and that they should ensure that they consume no more than 5,000 IU of preformed vitamin A (if any) per day. Although vitamin A is necessary for fetal development, most women carry stores of vitamin A in their fat cells, so over-supplementation should be strictly avoided.

A review of all randomized controlled trials in the scientific literature by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] published in ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]]'' in 2007 found that supplementation with β-carotene or vitamin A ''increased'' mortality by 5% and 16%, respectively.

Contrary to earlier observations, recent studies emerging from some developing countries (India, Bangladesh and Indonesia) have strongly suggested that in populations in which vitamin A deficiency is common and maternal mortality is high, dosing expectant mothers can greatly reduce the maternal mortality rate. Similarly, dosing newborn infants with 50,000 IU (15&amp;nbsp;mg) of vitamin A within two days of birth, can significantly reduce neonatal mortality.

Dutasteride has overall been found to be [[tolerability|well-tolerated]] in studies of both men and women, producing minimal [[side effect]]s. Isolated reports of [[menstruation|menstrual]] changes, [[acne]], and [[dizziness]] also exist. There is a very small risk of [[gynecomastia]] (breast enlargement) in men. 

The FDA has added a warning to dutasteride about an increased risk of high-grade [[prostate cancer]]. While the potential for positive, negative or neutral changes to the potential risk of developing prostate cancer with dutasteride has not been established, evidence has suggested it may temporarily reduce the growth and prevalence of benign prostate tumors, but could also mask the early detection of prostate cancer. The primary area for concern is for patients who may develop prostate cancer whilst taking dutasteride for benign prostatic hyperplasia, which in turn could delay diagnosis and early treatment of the prostate cancer, thereby potentially increasing the risk of these patients developing high-grade prostate cancer.

[[Sexual dysfunction]], such as [[erectile dysfunction]], [[loss of libido]], or [[hypospermia|reduced semen volume]], may occur in 3.4 to 15.8% of men treated with finasteride or dutasteride. This is linked to lower [[quality of life]] and can cause stress in relationships.

Several small studies have reported an association between 5α-reductase inhibitors and [[depression (mood)|depression]]. However, most studies have not observed this side effect. There have also been reports in a subset of men of long-lasting depression persisting even after discontinuation of dutasteride.

===Rare===
* Suicide through disinhibition [[disinhibition]], and [[sexual dysfunction]].

===Drowsiness===
Clonazepam, like other benzodiazepines, may impair a person's ability to drive or operate machinery. The central nervous system depressing effects of the drug can be intensified by alcohol consumption, and therefore alcohol should be avoided while taking this medication. Benzodiazepines have been shown to cause dependence. Patients dependent on clonazepam should be slowly titrated off under the supervision of a qualified healthcare professional to reduce the intensity of withdrawal or rebound symptoms.

===Withdrawal-related===
* Anxiety, irritability, insomnia, tremors
* Potential to exacerbate existing panic disorder upon discontinuation
* Seizures similar to [[delirium tremens]] (with long-term use of excessive doses)

Benzodiazepines such as clonazepam can be very effective in controlling [[status epilepticus]], but, when used for longer periods of time, some potentially serious side-effects may develop, such as interference with [[cognitive]] functions and behavior. Many individuals treated on a long-term basis develop a dependence. [[Physiological]] dependence was demonstrated by [[flumazenil]]-precipitated withdrawal. Use of alcohol or other [[Central nervous system|CNS]] depressants while taking clonazepam greatly intensifies the effects (and side-effects) of the drug.

A recurrence of symptoms of the underlying disease should be separated from withdrawal symptoms.

===Tolerance and withdrawal===
{{Main article|Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome}}
Like all benzodiazepines, clonazepam is a GABA-positive [[allosteric modulator]]. One-third of individuals treated with benzodiazepines for longer than four weeks develop a dependence on the drug and experience a withdrawal syndrome upon dose reduction. High dosage and long-term use increase the risk and severity of dependence and withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal seizures and psychosis can occur in severe cases of withdrawal, and anxiety and insomnia can occur in less severe cases of withdrawal. A gradual reduction in dosage reduces the severity of the [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]]. Due to the risks of tolerance and withdrawal seizures, clonazepam is generally not recommended for the long-term management of epilepsies. Increasing the dose can overcome the effects of tolerance, but tolerance to the higher dose may occur and adverse effects may intensify. The mechanism of tolerance includes receptor desensitization, down regulation, receptor decoupling, and alterations in subunit composition and in [[gene transcription]] coding.

[[Drug tolerance|Tolerance]] to the anticonvulsant effects of clonazepam occurs in both animals and humans. In humans, tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of clonazepam occurs frequently. Chronic use of benzodiazepines can lead to the development of tolerance with a decrease of benzodiazepine binding sites. The degree of tolerance is more pronounced with clonazepam than with [[chlordiazepoxide]]. In general, short-term therapy is more effective than long-term therapy with clonazepam for the treatment of epilepsy. Many studies have found that tolerance develops to the anticonvulsant properties of clonazepam with chronic use, which limits its long-term effectiveness as an anticonvulsant.

Abrupt or over-rapid withdrawal from clonazepam may result in the development of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, causing psychosis characterised by [[dysphoric]] manifestations, irritability, aggressiveness, anxiety, and hallucinations. Sudden withdrawal may also induce the potentially life-threatening condition, [[status epilepticus]]. Anti-epileptic drugs, benzodiazepines such as clonazepam in particular, should be reduced in dose slowly and gradually when discontinuing the drug to mitigate withdrawal effects. [[Carbamazepine]] has been tested in the treatment of clonazepam withdrawal but was found to be ineffective in preventing clonazepam withdrawal-induced [[status epilepticus]] from occurring.

===Overdose===
{{Main article|Benzodiazepine overdose}}
Excess doses may result in:
* [[Somnolence|Difficulty staying awake]]
* Mental confusion
* [[Nausea]]
* Impaired motor functions
** Impaired reflexes
** Impaired coordination
** Impaired balance
** Dizziness
* Respiratory depression
* [[Hypotension|Low blood pressure]]
* [[Coma]]

Coma can be cyclic, with the individual alternating from a comatose state to a hyper-alert state of consciousness, which occurred in a 4-year-old boy who suffered an overdose of clonazepam. The combination of clonazepam and certain barbiturates, e.g. [[amobarbital]], at prescribed doses has resulted in a [[synergistic]] potentiation of the effects of each drug, leading to serious respiratory depression.

Overdose symptoms may include extreme drowsiness, confusion, muscle weakness, and fainting.

===Detection in biological fluids===
Clonazepam and 7-aminoclonazepam may be quantified in [[Blood plasma|plasma]], [[serum (blood)|serum]] or [[whole blood]] in order to monitor compliance in those receiving the drug therapeutically. Results from such tests can be used to confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdosage. Both the parent drug and 7-aminoclonazepam are unstable in biofluids, and therefore specimens should be preserved with sodium fluoride, stored at the lowest possible temperature and analyzed quickly to minimize losses.

===Special precautions===
The elderly metabolize benzodiazepines more slowly than younger individuals and are also more sensitive to the effects of benzodiazepines, even at similar blood plasma levels. Doses for the elderly are recommended to be about half of that given to younger adults and are to be administered for no longer than two weeks. Long-acting benzodiazepines such as clonazepam are not generally recommended for the elderly due the risk of drug accumulation.

The elderly are especially susceptible to increased risk of harm from motor impairments and drug accumulation side effects. Benzodiazepines also require special precaution if used by individuals that may be pregnant, alcohol- or drug-dependent, or may have [[comorbid]] [[psychiatric disorders]].

Doses higher than 0.5–1&amp;nbsp;mg per day are associated with significant sedation.

Clonazepam may aggravate [[hepatic porphyria]].

Clonazepam is not recommended for patients with chronic [[schizophrenia]]. A 1982 double-blinded, placebo-controlled study found clonazepam increases violent behavior in individuals with chronic schizophrenia.

{{See also|Anabolic steroid#Adverse effects}}

Women who are administered oxandrolone may experience [[virilization]], irreversible development of masculine features such as [[voice deepening]], [[hirsutism]], [[menstrual disturbance|menstruation abnormalities]], [[male-pattern hair loss]], and [[clitoral enlargement]]. Oxandrolone may disrupt growth in children, reducing their adult height.{{Better source|date=June 2017}} Because of these side effects, doses given to women and children are minimized and people are usually monitored for virilization and growth abnormalities. Like other [[androgen]]s, oxandrolone can cause or worsen [[acne]] and [[priapism]] (unwanted or prolonged erections). In an attempt to compensate for the exogenous increase in androgens, the body may reduce [[testosterone]] production via [[testicular atrophy]] and inhibition of [[gonadotropic]] activity.

Unlike some AAS, oxandrolone does not generally cause [[gynecomastia]] because it is not [[aromatized]] into [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]]ic metabolites. Though transient gynecomastia is a natural and common occurrence in pubertal boys, the gynecomastia associated with oxandrolone was of a late/delayed onset and was persistent in a high percentage of the cases. As such, the researchers stated, &quot;although oxandrolone cannot be implicated as stimulatory [in] gynecomastia&quot;, a possible relationship should be considered in clinicians using oxandrolone in adolescents for growth stimulation.

Uniquely among 17α-alkylated AAS, oxandrolone shows little to no [[hepatotoxicity]], even at high doses. However, [[elevated liver enzymes]] have been observed in some people, particularly with high doses and/or prolonged treatment, although they return to normal ranges following discontinuation. In any case, oxandrolone may be among the safest 17α-alkylated AAS in terms of hepatotoxicity.{{ums|date=November 2017}}

Compared to other SSRIs, sertraline tends to be associated with a higher rate of psychiatric side effects and diarrhea. The incidence of diarrhea is higher with sertraline&amp;mdash;especially when prescribed at higher doses&amp;mdash;in comparison to other SSRIs. (or 61% vs. 0% according to another paper). Similarly, in a group of women who initially did not have difficulties achieving orgasm, 41% acquired this problem during treatment with sertraline. A 40% rate of [[anorgasmia|orgasm dysfunction]] (vs. 9% for placebo) on sertraline was observed in a mixed group in another study.

===Suicide===
The FDA requires all antidepressants, including sertraline, to carry a [[boxed warning]] stating that antidepressants may increase the risk of suicide in persons younger than 25 years. This warning is based on statistical analyses conducted by two independent groups of FDA experts that found a twofold increase of suicidal ideation and behavior in children and adolescents, and a 1.5-fold increase of suicidal behavior in the 18–24 age group. or 50% depending on the statistical technique used. The authors of the FDA analysis note that &quot;given the large number of comparisons made in this review, chance is a very plausible explanation for this difference&quot;. The more complete data submitted later by the sertraline manufacturer Pfizer indicated increased suicidal behavior. Similarly, the analysis conducted by the UK [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency|MHRA]] found a 50% increase of odds of suicide-related events, not reaching statistical significance, in the patients on sertraline as compared to the ones on placebo.

Concerns have been raised that suicidal acts among participants in multiple studies were not reported in published articles reporting the studies.

===Discontinuation syndrome===
{{Main article|Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome}}

Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is a condition that can occur following the interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of antidepressant drugs, including sertraline. The symptoms can include flu-like symptoms and disturbances in sleep, senses, movement, mood, and thinking. In most cases symptoms are mild, short-lived, and resolve without treatment. More severe cases are often successfully treated by temporary reintroduction of the drug with a slower tapering off rate.

    <title>Desomorphine</title>


===Toxicity===
====Toxicity of desomorphine====
Animal studies comparing pure desomorphine to morphine showed it to have increased [[toxicity]], more potent [[Analgesic|relief of pain]], higher levels of [[sedation]], decreased [[Anaerobic respiration|respiration]], and increased [[digestion|digestive]] activity.

====Toxicity of &quot;krokodil&quot;====
Illicitly produced desomorphine is typically far from pure and often contains large amounts of [[toxic]] substances as a result of being &quot;cooked&quot; and used without any significant effort to remove the byproducts and leftovers from synthesis. Injecting any such mixture can cause serious damage to the [[skin]], [[blood vessels]], [[bone]] and [[muscles]], sometimes requiring limb amputation in long-term users.

Causes of this damage are from [[iodine]] and [[phosphorus]] (and other toxic substances) that are present after synthesis. Addicts often use readily available but relatively toxic and impure solvents such as gasoline or paint thinner during the reaction scheme, without adequately removing them afterwards before injection. Strong acids and bases such as hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide are also employed without measuring [[pH]] of the final solution and analysis of leftover solutions of &quot;krokodil&quot; in used syringes showed the pH was typically less than 3 (i.e. as acidic as lemon juice). Failure to remove insoluble fillers and binding aids from the codeine tablets used as starting material, as well as co-administration with pharmaceuticals such as [[tropicamide]] and [[tianeptine]], are also cited as possible contributors to the high toxicity observed in users.

The frequent occurrence of tissue damage and infection among illicit users are what gained the drug its nickname of the [[flesh-eating disease|flesh-eating]] drug,or the zombie drug as homemade versions made under inadequate conditions contain multiple impurities and toxic substances that lead to severe tissue damage and subsequent infection as a direct consequence of use. The pure form of the drug itself does not cause this damage and, despite the severe health impacts and short survival times commonly reported, there are also rarer cases of krokodil users more skilled in the manufacturing process who have used the drug for many years without experiencing the tissue damage associated with the impure &quot;street&quot; product. Sometimes, the user will miss the vein when injecting the desomorphine, creating an [[abscess]] and causing death of the flesh surrounding the entry-point.

===Reinforcement disorders===
Early medical trials of humans taking desomorphine have resulted in the finding that, like morphine and most other analgesics of the morphine type, small amounts are highly [[addictive]] and tolerance to the drug develops quickly. However, though tolerance to respiratory depression with repeated doses was observed in rats, early clinical trials failed to show any tolerance to these same effects with repeated doses in humans.

    <title>Ivabradine</title>

Overall, 14.5% of patients taking ivabradine experience [[phosphene|luminous phenomena]] (by patients described as sensations of enhanced brightness in a fully maintained visual field). This is probably due to blockage of I&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt; ion channels in the [[retina]], which are very similar to cardiac I&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;. These symptoms are mild, transient, and fully reversible. In clinical studies, about 1% of all patients had to discontinue the drug because of these sensations, which occurred on average 40 days after the drug was started.

In a large clinical trial, [[bradycardia]] (unusually slow heart rate) occurred in 2% and 5% of patients taking ivabradine at doses of 7.5 and 10&amp;nbsp;mg respectively (compared to 4.3% in those taking atenolol). 2.6–4.8% reported [[headache]]s. Other common [[adverse drug reaction]]s (1–10% of patients) include first-degree [[heart block|AV block]], [[Premature ventricular contraction|ventricular extrasystoles]], dizziness and/or blurred vision.

    <title>Sunitinib</title>

Sunitinib adverse events are considered somewhat manageable and the incidence of serious adverse events low.

The most common adverse events associated with sunitinib therapy are fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, anorexia, hypertension, a yellow skin discoloration, hand-foot skin reaction, and stomatitis. In the placebo-controlled Phase III GIST study, adverse events which occurred more often with sunitinib than placebo included diarrhea, anorexia, skin discoloration, mucositis/stomatitis, asthenia, altered taste, and constipation.

Dose reductions were required in 50% of the patients studied in RCC in order to manage the significant toxicities of this agent.

Serious (grade 3 or 4) adverse events occur in ≤10% of patients and include hypertension, fatigue, asthenia, diarrhea, and [[chemotherapy-induced acral erythema]]. Lab abnormalities associated with sunitinib therapy include lipase, amylase, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and platelets. Hypothyroidism and reversible erythrocytosis have also been associated with sunitinib.

Most adverse events can be managed through supportive care, dose interruption, or dose reduction.

A recent study done at MD Anderson Cancer Center compared the outcomes of metastatic renal cell cancer patients who received sunitinib on the standard schedule (50&amp;nbsp;mg/4 weeks on 2 weeks off)  with those who received sunitinib with more frequent and short drug holidays (alternative schedule). It was seen that the overall survival, progression free survival and drug adherence were significantly higher in the patients who received Sunitinib on the alternative schedule. Patients also had a better tolerance and lower severity of adverse events which frequently lead to discontinuation of treatment of metastatic renal cell cancer patients.

Common and mild [[side effect]]s of nefazodone reported in [[clinical trial]]s more often than [[placebo]] include [[dry mouth]] (25%), sleepiness (25%), nausea (22%), dizziness (17%), blurred vision (16%), [[weakness]] (11%), lightheadedness (10%), confusion (7%), and [[orthostatic hypotension]] (5%). Rare and serious adverse reactions may include allergic reactions, fainting, [[priapism|painful/prolonged erection]], and [[jaundice]].

Nefazodone is not especially associated with increased appetite and weight gain.

    <title>Dacarbazine</title>

Like many chemotherapy drugs, dacarbazine may have numerous serious side effects, because it interferes with normal cell growth as well as cancer cell growth.  Among the most serious possible side effects are birth defects to children conceived or carried during treatment; sterility, possibly permanent; or immune suppression (reduced ability to fight infection or disease). Dacarbazine is considered to be highly [[Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting|emetogenic]], and most patients will be pre-medicated with [[dexamethasone]] and antiemetic drugs like [[5-HT3 antagonist|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; antagonist]] (e.g., [[ondansetron]]) and/or [[NK1 receptor antagonist|NK&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonist]] (e.g., [[aprepitant]]). Other significant side effects include headache, fatigue and occasionally diarrhea.

The Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare has sent out a [[Boxed warning|black box warning]] and suggests avoiding dacarbazine due to liver problems.

===Adverse effects by frequency===

'''&lt;big&gt;Systemic use, when being used to treat chronic hand eczema&lt;/big&gt;''' Toctino (the oral capsule formulation of alitretinoin) contains soya oil and sorbitol. Patients who are allergic to peanut, soya or with rare hereditary fructose intolerance should not take this medicine. It is also contraindicated in nursing mothers. The oral formulation of alitretinoin is contraindicated in patients with: 
{{colbegin|3}}
* Hepatic insufficiency
* Severe renal insufficiency
* Uncontrolled [[hypercholesterolemia]]
* Uncontrolled [[hypertriglyceridemia]]
* Uncontrolled [[hypothyroidism]]
* [[Hypervitaminosis A]]
* Hypersensitivity to any excipients in alitretinoin
{{colend}}

===Interactions===
It is a [[CYP3A4]] substrate and hence any inhibitor or inducer of this enzyme may alter plasma levels of alitretinoin. It should not be given to patients with excess vitamin A in their system as there is a potential for its actions on the [[retinoid X receptor]] to be exacerbated. It may also interact with [[tetracycline]]s to cause benign [[intracranial hypertension]].

===Overdose===
Alitretinoin is a form of vitamin A. Alitretinoin has been administered in oncological clinical studies at dosages of more than 10-times of the therapeutic dosage given for chronic hand eczema. The adverse effects observed were consistent with retinoid toxicity, and included severe headache, diarrhoea, facial flushing and [[hypertriglyceridemia]]. These effects were reversible.

Rare side-effects include [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]], an adverse reaction to barbiturates, and [[anaphylaxis]].

The risk and severity of all side effects is greatly increased when butalbital (or butalbital-based medications, such as [[Fioricet]]) are combined with other sedatives (ex. [[ethanol]], [[opiates]], [[benzodiazepines]], [[antihistamines]]), and other side effects, which are not typically associated with butalbital, may occur. Inhibitors of the hepatic enzyme CYP3A4 may also increase the risk, severity, and duration of side effects, many drugs inhibit this enzyme as do some foods such as [[grapefruit]] and the [[blood orange]]. Taking butalbital-based medications with some other drugs may also increase the side effects of the other medication.

Ramelteon has not been shown to produce dependence and has shown no potential for abuse, and the withdrawal and [[rebound insomnia]] that is typical with [[GABA]] modulators is not present in ramelteon.

Six percent of ramelteon-treated patients in clinical trials discontinued due to an adverse event, compared to 2% in the placebo arms. The most frequent adverse events leading to discontinuation were somnolence, dizziness, nausea, fatigue, headache, and insomnia.  The United States official Prescribing Information warns of rare cases of anaphylactic reactions, abnormal thinking, and suicide in patients with pre-existing depression.

In mice treated with ramelteon for two years, increases in liver and testicular tumors were observed, but only at doses at least 20 times greater than the recommended human dose on a milligram/kilogram basis.

===Central nervous system===
[[somnolence|Sleepiness]] (12.5%), [[headache]] (3.8%), dizziness (3.8%), nervousness (2.7%), [[clinical depression|depression]] (2.5%), memory disturbances (2.3%), [[diplopia]] (2.2%), aggression (2.0%), [[ataxia]] (1.9%), [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]] (1.9%), [[hyperactivity]] (1.8%), vision loss (1.6%) (See below), [[mental confusion|confusion]] (1.4%), [[insomnia]] (1.3%), impaired concentration (1.2%), [[personality disorder|personality issues]] (1.1%). Out of 299 children, 33 (11%) became hyperactive.

Some patients develop [[psychosis]] during the course of vigabatrin therapy,

===Gastrointestinal===
Abdominal pain (1.6%), constipation (1.4%), vomiting (1.4%), and nausea (1.4%). [[Dyspepsia]] and increased appetite occurred in less than 1% of subjects in clinical trials.

===Body as a whole===
Fatigue (9.2%), weight gain (5.0%), [[asthenia]] (1.1%).

===Teratogenicity===
A [[teratology]] study conducted in rabbits found that a dose of 150&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day caused [[cleft palate]] in 2% of pups and a dose of 200&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day caused it in 9%. This may be due to a decrease in [[methionine]] levels, according to a study published in March 2001. In 2005, a study conducted at the University of Catania was published stating that rats whose mothers had consumed 250–1000&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day had poorer performance in the [[water maze]] and [[open-field task]]s, rats in the 750-mg group were underweight at birth and did not catch up to the control group, and rats in the 1000&amp;nbsp;mg group did not survive pregnancy.

There is no controlled teratology data in humans to date.

===Sensory===
In 2003, vigabatrin was shown by Frisén and Malmgren to cause irreversible diffuse [[atrophy]] of the [[retina]]l [[nerve fiber]] layer in a [[retrospective]] study of 25 patients. This has the most effect on the outer area (as opposed to the [[macula]]r, or central area) of the retina.
Visual field defects had been reported as early as 1997 by Tom Eke and others, in the UK. Some authors, including Comaish et al. believe that visual field loss and electrophysiological changes may be demonstrable in up to 50% of Vigabatrin users.

The retinal toxicity of vigabatrin can be attributed to a [[taurine]] depletion.

Commonly reported side effects of cetirizine include [[headache]] (16%), [[dry mouth]] (5.7%), [[drowsiness]] (5–20%), and [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] (5.6%), while more serious but rare side effects include [[cardiac failure]], [[tachycardia]], and [[edema]].

===Withdrawal===
Long-term daily usage of cetirizine may result in what resembles antihistamine dependency. No official study has been conducted to determine how long a patient may take cetirizine daily before expecting to encounter withdrawal symptoms when treatment stops. Many patients seeking help with withdrawal symptoms report having taken cetirizine for more than three years, while others report having taken it for no longer than one week.

Insatiable, generalized itching is the most commonly-reported withdrawal side effect, though others have reported severe [[rebound effect|rebound]] of original, pre-treatment systems as well, including sneezing and runny nose.

===Humans===
Xylazine overdose is usually fatal in humans. Because it is used as a drug [[adulterant]], the symptoms caused by the drugs accompanying xylazine administration vary between individuals.

The most common side effects in humans associated with xylazine administration include bradycardia, [[respiratory depression]], hypotension, transient [[hypertension]] secondary to [[vagus nerve stimulation]], and other changes in cardiac output. Xylazine significantly decreases heart rate in animals that are not premedicated with medications that have [[anticholinergic]] effects. The decrease in heart rate directly impacts [[aortic]] flow. Bradycardia caused by xylazine administration is effectively prevented by administration of [[atropine]] or [[glycopyrrolate]]. [[Arrhythmias]] associated with xylazine includes other symptoms such as [[sinoatrial block]], [[atrioventricular block]], [[Ventricular inversion|A-V dissociation]], and [[sinus arrhythmia]].

Xylazine administration can lead to [[diabetes mellitus]] and [[hyperglycemia]]. Other possible side effects that can occur are [[areflexia]], [[asthenia]], [[ataxia]], blurred vision, [[disorientation]], dizziness, drowsiness, [[dysarthria]], [[dysmetria]], fainting, [[hyporeflexia]], slurred speech, [[somnolence]], staggering, [[coma]], [[apnea]], shallow breathing, sleepiness, [[premature ventricular contraction]], [[tachycardia]], [[miosis]], and dry mouth. Rarely, [[hypotonia]], dry mouth, [[urinary incontinence]] and nonspecific electrocardiographic [[ST segment]] changes occur. It has been reported that the duration of symptoms after human overdose is 8 to 72 hours. Further research is necessary to categorize the side effects that occur when xylazine is used in conjunction with heroin and cocaine.

Chronic use is reported to be associated with physical deterioration, dependence, [[abscesses]], and [[skin ulcer]]ation, which can be physically debilitating and painful. Hypertension followed by hypotension, bradycardia, and respiratory depression lower tissue oxygenation in the skin. Thus, chronic use of xylazine can progress the skin oxygenation deficit, leading to severe skin ulceration. Lower skin oxygenation is associated with impaired healing of wounds and a higher chance of infection. The ulcers may have a characteristic odor and ooze pus. In severe cases, amputations must be performed on the affected extremities.

===Animals===

Side effects in animals include transient hypertension, hypotension, and respiratory depression. Further, the decrease of tissue sensitivity to insulin leads to xylazine-induced hyperglycemia and a reduction of tissue glucose uptake and utilization. The duration of effects in animals lasts up to 4 hours.

Vortioxetine used alone in high dose or in combination with other medications, such as other antidepressants, can produce a potentially life-threatening drug reaction known as [[serotonin syndrome]].

Incidence of sexual dysfunction is higher in patients taking vortioxetine than in people taking [[placebo]]s but appears to be lower than in people taking most other antidepressants.

    <title>Cefalexin</title>

The most common adverse effects of cefalexin, like other oral cephalosporins, are gastrointestinal (stomach area) disturbances and hypersensitivity reactions.  Gastrointestinal disturbances include [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], and [[diarrhea]], diarrhea being most common.  [[Hypersensitivity reaction]]s include skin rashes, [[urticaria]], [[fever]], and [[anaphylaxis]].

Signs and symptoms of an [[allergic reaction]] include rash, itching, swelling, trouble breathing, or red, blistered, swollen, or peeling skin. Overall, cefalexin allergy occurs in less than 0.1% of patients, but it is seen in 1% to 10% of patients with a penicillin allergy.

    <title>Procaine</title>

Application of procaine leads to the depression of neuronal activity. The depression causes the nervous system to become hypersensitive, producing restlessness and shaking, leading to minor to severe convulsions. Studies on animals have shown the use of procaine led to the increase of [[dopamine]] and [[serotonin]] levels in the brain.  Other issues may occur because of varying individual tolerance to procaine dosage. Nervousness and dizziness can arise from the excitation of the central nervous system, which may lead to respiratory failure if overdosed. Procaine may also induce weakening of the [[myocardium]] leading to [[cardiac arrest]].

Procaine can also cause allergic reactions causing individuals to have problems with breathing, rashes, and swelling. Allergic reactions to procaine are usually not in response to procaine itself, but to its metabolite PABA. About one in 3000 white North Americans is homozygotic (i.e. has two copies of the abnormal gene) for the most common atypical form of the enzyme pseudocholinesterase,

===Diabetes-like symptoms===
While sirolimus inhibition of [[mTORC1]] appears to mediate the drug's benefits, it also inhibits [[mTORC2]], which results in diabetes-like symptoms.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} This includes decreased glucose tolerance and insensitivity to insulin. Sirolimus treatment may additionally increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. In mouse studies, these symptoms can be avoided through the use of alternate dosing regimens or [[Substrate analog|analogs]] such as [[everolimus]] or [[temsirolimus]].

    <title>Benzocaine</title>

Benzocaine is generally well-tolerated and non-toxic when applied topically as recommended.

However, there have been reports of serious, life-threatening adverse effects (e.g., seizures, coma, irregular heart beat, respiratory depression) with over-application of topical products or when applying topical products that contain high concentrations of benzocaine to the skin.

Overapplication of oral anesthetics such as benzocaine can increase the risk of [[pulmonary aspiration]] by relaxing the gag-reflex and allowing regurgitated stomach contents or oral secretions to enter the airway. Applying an oral anesthetic and consuming beverages before going to bed can be particularly hazardous.

The topical use of higher concentration (14-20%) benzocaine spray products applied to the mouth or mucous membranes has been found to be a cause of [[methemoglobinemia]], a disorder in which the amount of oxygen carried by the blood is greatly reduced. This side effect is most common in children under 2 years of age. As a result, the FDA has stated that benzocaine products should not be used in children under 2 years of age, unless directed by and supervised by a healthcare professional.

Benzocaine may cause allergic reactions. These include:

Possible side effects include [[diarrhea]], vomiting, [[nausea]], [[candidiasis|thrush]], and skin [[rash]]. These do not usually require medical attention. As with all antimicrobial agents, [[antibiotic-associated diarrhea]] due to ''[[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|Clostridium difficile]]'' infection—sometimes leading to [[pseudomembranous colitis]]—may occur during or after treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.

Rarely, [[cholestasis|cholestatic jaundice]] (also referred to as cholestatic hepatitis, a form of [[hepatotoxicity|liver toxicity]]) has been associated with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. The reaction may occur up to several weeks after treatment has stopped, and usually takes weeks to resolve. It is more frequent in men, older people, and those who have taken long courses of treatment; the estimated overall incidence is one in 100,000 exposures. In the United Kingdom, co-amoxiclav carries a warning from the [[Committee on Safety of Medicines]] to this effect.

As all [[aminopenicillin]]s, amoxicillin has been associated with [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]]/[[toxic epidermal necrolysis]], although these reactions are very rare.

Side effects tend to be common and occur more frequently with increased age. It is reported that up to 30% of people will experience dermatitis when starting treatment. Rashes usually appear within the first 2 weeks of treatment and resolve over time. In rare instances, skin hypersensitivity can result in exfoliative skin eruptions, edema, and fever. [[Peripheral neuropathy]] may occur later on in the treatment course and is dose dependent. It is not permanent, but takes time to resolve.

Other adverse reactions include anorexia, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, and [[Dysgeusia|dysguesia]], and bone marrow suppression. Gastrointestinal symptoms usually occur during the initial stages of treatment and resolves over time. Bone marrow suppression has been linked to the cumulative dose exposure.

In those taking [[sulphonylurea]]s there is an increased risk of [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugar]].

3 adverse reactions were seen higher in saxagliptin vs placebo.
Table 1: Adverse Reactions (Regardless of Investigator Assessment of Causality) in Placebo-Controlled Trials* Reported in ≥ 5% of Patients Treated with ONGLYZA (saxagliptin tablets) 5&amp;nbsp;mg and More Commonly than in Patients Treated with Placebo.

* The 5 placebo-controlled trials include two monotherapy trials and one add-on combination therapy trial with each of the following: metformin, thiazolidinedione, or glyburide. Table shows 24-week data regardless of glycemic rescue.

In February 2012, Bristol-Myers/Astra Zeneca distributed additional safety information on saxagliptin use in South Africa. The package insert is to be edited for South Africa. Contraindications will now include a history of sensitivity to saxagliptin (or another DPP4 inhibitor) as well as pancreatitis. Spontaneously-reported adverse events in South Africa have included anaphylaxis, angioedema and acute pancreatitis.

In a cardiovascular outcomes trial, saxagliptin treatment let to a small increase in the risk of being hospitalized for heart failure. Saxagliptin may cause joint pain that can be severe and disabling. On April 14, 2015, an FDA advisory panel voted 14-1 in favor of adding information about heart failure risks to the label of saxagliptin.

===Tolerability===
Both monotherapy and combination therapy with other agents was generally well tolerated in clinical trials.

===Pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer===
An association of the DPP-IV inhibitor class with pancreatic problems has been proposed, mainly based on case reports associated with the DPP-IV inhibitor sitagliptin and several incretin mimetics including [[exenatide]]. A 2013 study of the DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin reported found &quot;worrisome changes in the pancreases of the rats that could lead to pancreatic cancer&quot;. A second paper by the same authors reported an increase in precancerous lesions in the pancreases of organ donors who had taken GLP-1 inhibitors. In response to these reports, the United States FDA and the European Medicines Agency each undertook independent reviews of all clinical and preclinical data related to the possible association of DPP-IV inhibitors with pancreatic cancer. In a joint letter to the New England Journal of Medicines, the agencies stated that &quot;Both agencies agree that assertions concerning a causal association between incretin-based drugs and pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer, as expressed recently in the scientific literature and in the media, are inconsistent with the current data. The FDA and the EMA have not reached a final conclusion at this time regarding such a causal relationship. Although the totality of the data that have been reviewed provides reassurance, pancreatitis will continue to be considered a risk associated with these drugs until more data are available; both agencies continue to investigate this safety signal.&quot;

Lawsuits have been filed in which plaintiffs who developed pancreatic cancer claim that DPP-IV inhibitors or incretins had a causative role in the development of their cancers.

More recent studies have shown similar degrees of [[somnolence]] (approx. 2%) compared with placebo treatment. The problem of bitter taste may be reduced by correct application of the nasal spray (i.e. slightly tipping the head forward and not inhaling the medication too deeply), or alternatively using the azelastine/sucralose formulation.

    <title>Bupivacaine</title>


Compared to other local anaesthetics, bupivacaine is markedly [[cardiotoxic]]. However, [[adverse drug reaction]]s (ADRs) are rare when it is administered correctly. Most ADRs are caused by accelerated absorption from the injection site, unintentional intravascular injection, or slow metabolic degradation.  However, [[allergy|allergic]] reactions can rarely occur.

Clinically significant adverse events result from systemic absorption of bupivacaine and primarily involve the central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular system.  CNS effects typically occur at lower [[blood plasma]] concentrations.  Initially, cortical inhibitory pathways are selectively inhibited, causing symptoms of neuronal excitation.  At higher plasma concentrations, both inhibitory and excitatory pathways are inhibited, causing CNS depression and potentially coma.  Higher plasma concentrations also lead to cardiovascular effects, though cardiovascular collapse may also occur with low concentrations.  Adverse CNS effects may indicate impending cardiotoxicity and should be carefully monitored.

Toxicity can also occur in the setting of subarachnoid injection during high spinal anesthesia.  These effects include: [[parasthesia]], [[paralysis]], [[apnea]], [[hypoventilation]], [[fecal incontinence]], and [[urinary incontinence]].  Additionally, bupivacaine can cause [[chondrolysis]] after continuous infusion into a joint space.

Bupivacaine has caused several deaths when the epidural anaesthetic has been administered intravenously accidentally.

The incidence of adverse effects with Benicar (the US trade name for olmesartan medoxomil) is reported as similar to placebo; the only adverse effect that occurred in &gt;1% of patients treated with it and more frequently than placebo was dizziness (3% vs 1%).  The full prescribing information for Benicar notes as with all drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system, olmesartan is contraindicated in pregnancy and can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. In studies of angiotensin II receptor antagonists such as olmesartan, patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen have been reported. There has been no long-term use of olmesartan medoxomil in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but similar results may be expected.
Rarely, olmesartan can cause severe [[gastrointestinal issues]]. The symptoms, which include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, and electrolyte abnormalities, are common among those who have [[celiac disease]]. Recent studies suggested this form of sprue-like enteropathy could be caused by the inhibition of [[Transforming growth factor beta|TGF-β]], a polypeptide cytokine that maintains intestinal homeostasis. However, it is still unclear why this action was never observed with other ARBs.

* Hypersensitivity reactions : Local or generalized [[skin reactions]] ([[rash]] and [[urticaria]]); appearance of neutralizing [[antibodies]] to ancrod with partial or total loss of ancrod activity (drug resistance).
* Sometimes pain at injection site (normally mild). This side effect may be, if necessary, treated with local or oral [[antihistaminic]] drugs (e.g., [[clemastine]], or [[diphenhydramine]]). Bleeding at injection site, [[thrombophlebitis]] at local veins, and (paradoxical) arterial thrombotic events.
* Occasionally deposition of cleaved fibrinogen derivates in the spleen resulting in [[splenomegaly]]; rupture is possible, if the [[spleen]] is palpated too strongly (life-threatening bleeding and need of [[splenectomy]] may result).
* Specific side effects are local and systemic bleeding events. Local bleeding events may be treated with local pressure or [[surgical dressings]], if necessary. Compared with other anticoagulants the risk of systemic bleeding is relatively low. If systemic bleeding is severe enough to warrant fast reversal of ancrod action, fibrinogen should be substituted (please refer to section 'special antidotes').
* Occasionally, increased headache has been found in patients with known [[migraine]].
* Also, [[chills]] and [[fever]] may occur infrequently.

[[Thrombocytopenia]] as side effect has never been noticed with ancrod in contrast to heparin.

Teriparatide has a theoretical risk of [[osteosarcoma]], which was found in rat studies but not confirmed in humans. This may be because unlike humans, rat bones grow for their entire life. The tumors found in the rat studies were located on the end of the bones which grew after the injections began. This risk was considered by the FDA as &quot;extremely rare&quot; (1 in 100,000 people) and is only slightly more than the incidence in the population over 60 years old (0.4 in 100,000).

Clinical studies have shown that the most common side effect is a slight reaction at the site of injection in the form of redness, and sometimes swelling. Clinical studies have shown that, one hour after injection, the incidence of at least one moderate or severe local skin reaction per treatment cycle was 12% in 4 patients treated with ganirelix and 25% in patients treated subcutaneously with a GnRH agonist. The local reactions generally disappear within 4 hours after administration.
Other reported side effects are some that are known to be associated with ovarian hyperstimulation, including gynecological abdominal pain, headache, vaginal bleeding, nausea, and gastrointestinal abdominal pain. In some rare cases, less than 1 user in 10,000, hypersensitivity to ganirelix can cause anaphylactoid reactions, most likely due to allergy.

===Birth defects===
A follow-up analysis for ganirelix done by the Marketing Authorisation Holder compared the number of congenital malformations between individuals whose mothers were treated with ganirelix compared with individuals whose mothers were treated with a GnRH agonist. The total number of congenital malformations was higher in the ganirelix group than in the GnRH agonist group (7.6% vs. 5.5%).

* [[Hepatitis B]] infection or reactivation

Ofatumumab has received a [[black box warning]] regarding the potential for it to cause [[progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy]] and [[hepatitis B]] reactivation.

===Contraindications===
It is contraindicated in individuals that have hypersensitivity to ofatumumab or any of its excipients.

===Interactions===
No formal drug interaction studies have been conducted with ofatumumab. Although it is advised that patients are not administered live virus vaccines (e.g. the oral polio vaccine) while undergoing treatment with ofatumumab due to the compromised ability to fight the attenuated viruses seen in patients being treated with ofatumumab.

    <title>Norethisterone</title>

At contraceptive and hormone replacement dosages (0.35 to 1&amp;nbsp;mg/day), norethisterone has essentially progestogenic [[side effect]]s only. In most clinical studies of norethisterone for contraception or menopausal hormone therapy, the drug has been combined with an estrogen, and for this reason, it is difficult to determine which of the side effects were caused by norethisterone and which of them were caused by estrogen in such research. However, NETE, an intramuscularly administered prodrug of norethisterone which is used as a long-acting contraceptive, is used without an estrogen, and hence can be employed as a surrogate for norethisterone in terms of understanding its effects and [[tolerability]]. In clinical studies, the most common side effect with NETE has been [[menstrual disturbance]]s, including [[dysfunctional uterine bleeding|prolonged bleeding or spotting]] and [[amenorrhea]].{{rp|253}} Other side effects have included periodic [[abdominal bloating]] and [[breast tenderness]], both of which are thought to be due to [[water retention (medicine)|water retention]] and can be relieved with [[diuretic]]s.{{rp|253}} There has been no association with [[weight gain]], and [[blood pressure]], [[blood clotting]], and [[glucose tolerance]] have all remained normal.{{rp|253}} However, a decrease in [[HDL cholesterol|{{abbr|HDL|high-density lipoprotein}} cholesterol]] has been observed.{{rp|253}}

At high dosages (5 to 60&amp;nbsp;mg/day), for instance those used in the treatment of gynecological disorders, norethisterone can cause [[hypogonadism]] due to its [[antigonadotropic]] effects and can have estrogenic and weak androgenic side effects.

===Androgenic===
Due to its weak androgenic activity, norethisterone can produce androgenic [[side effect]]s such as [[acne]], [[hirsutism]], and [[voice change]]s of slight severity in some women at high dosages (e.g., 10 to 40&amp;nbsp;mg/day). in combination with [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]] and are actually associated with improvement in acne symptoms. The improvement in acne symptoms is believed to be due to a 2- to 3-fold increase in [[sex hormone-binding globulin]] (SHBG) levels and a consequent decrease in free [[testosterone]] levels caused by EE, which results in an overall decrease in androgenic signaling in the body. Conversely, dosages of norethisterone of 0.5 to 3&amp;nbsp;mg/day have been found to dose-dependently decrease SHBG levels (and hence to suppress hepatic SHBG production), which is another highly sensitive marker of androgenicity.

A large clinical study of high to very high oral dosages of norethisterone (10 to 40&amp;nbsp;mg/day) administered for prolonged periods of time (4 to 35 weeks) to prevent [[miscarriage]] in [[pregnancy|pregnant]] women found that 5.5% of the women experienced mild androgenic side effects such as mild [[voice change]]s ([[hoarseness]]), acne, and [[hirsutism]] and that 18.3% of female infants born to the mothers showed, in most cases only slight, [[virilization]] of the [[genital]]s. Maternal androgenic symptoms occurred most often in women who received a dosage of norethisterone of 30&amp;nbsp;mg/day or more for a period of 15&amp;nbsp;weeks or longer. In the female infants who experienced virilization of the genitals, the sole manifestation in 86.7% of the cases was varied but almost always slight enlargement of the clitoris. In the remaining 13.3% of the affected cases, marked clitoral enlargement and partial fusion of the [[labioscrotal swelling|labioscrotal fold]]s occurred. The dosages used in these cases were 20 to 40&amp;nbsp;mg/day.

In a letter to the editor on the topic of virilization caused by high dosages of NETA in women, a physician expressed that they had not observed the &quot;slightest evidence of virilization&quot; and that there had &quot;certainly been no hirsutism nor any voice changes&quot; in 55&amp;nbsp;women with advanced breast cancer that they had treated with 30 to 60&amp;nbsp;mg/day norethisterone for up to six&amp;nbsp;months. Side effects including [[weight gain]], [[hirsutism]], [[acne]], [[headache]], [[nausea]], and [[vomiting]] all did not appear to increase in incidence and no &quot;disturbing side effects&quot; were noted in any of the women. Another study of 5&amp;nbsp;mg/day norethisterone in 132 women also made no mention of androgenic side effects. A study of 194 women treated with 5 to 15&amp;nbsp;mg/day NETA for a median duration of 13 months of therapy to suppress symptoms of [[endometriosis]] observed no side effects in 55.2% of patients, weight gain in 16.1%, acne in 9.9%, [[mood lability]] in 8.9%, [[hot flash]]es in 8.3%, and voice deepening in two women (1.0%).

===Estrogenic===
Norethisterone is weakly [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]]ic (via conversion into its [[metabolite]] EE), and for this reason, it has been found at high dosages to be associated with high rates of estrogenic side effects such as [[breast enlargement]] in women and [[gynecomastia]] in men, but also with improvement of [[menopause|menopausal]] [[symptom]]s in postmenopausal women. It has been suggested that very high dosages (e.g., 40&amp;nbsp;mg/day, which are sometimes used in clinical practice for various indications) of NETA (and by extension norethisterone) may result in an increased risk of [[venous thromboembolism]] (VTE) analogously to high dosages (above 50&amp;nbsp;μg/day) of EE, and that even dosages of NETA of 10 to 20&amp;nbsp;mg, which correspond to EE dosages of approximately 20 to 30&amp;nbsp;μg/day, may in certain women be associated with increased risk.

    <title>Rabeprazole</title>

In general, rabeprazole is fairly well tolerated, even up to 5 years after clinical trial follow-up. The [[side effect]] profile is similar to that of [[omeprazole]]. The most common side effects include [[headache]], [[nausea]], and [[diarrhea]]. Rare side effects include rashes, flu-like symptoms, and infections (including by the gastrointestinal pathogen ''[[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|Clostridium difficile]]''). Rare instances of rabeprazole-induced [[liver]] injury (also known as hepatotoxicity) have been reported. Characteristic proton-pump inhibitor hepatoxicity usually occurs within the first 4 weeks of starting the medication.

Rabeprazole is associated with elevated serum [[gastrin]] levels, which are thought to be dependent upon the degree of [[CYP2C19]] metabolism the drug undergoes. In comparison, rabeprazole is not as significantly metabolized by this enzyme compared to other medications in the same class, like omeprazole. Elevated serum gastrin may be associated with gastric cancer.

Very serious side effects have been reported in people taking rabeprazole, but these effects have not been &quot;correlated directly&quot; with the use of rabeprazole. These include [[Stevens-Johnson syndrome]], serious [[hematology|hematological]] abnormalities, coma, and death. Other possible side effects, common to other PPIs medications in the same class, include bone fractures due to [[osteoporosis]] and serious infections with ''Clostridium difficile''.

{{See also|List of side effects of bupropion}}

[[Epileptic seizure]]s are the most important adverse effect of bupropion. A high incidence of seizures was responsible for the temporary withdrawal of the drug from the market between 1986 and 1989. The risk of seizure is strongly dose-dependent, but also dependent on the preparation. The sustained-release preparation is associated with a seizure incidence of 0.1% at daily dosages of less than 300&amp;nbsp;mg of bupropion and 0.4% at 300–400&amp;nbsp;mg. For comparison, the incidence of unprovoked seizure in the general population is 0.07 to 0.09%, and the risk of seizure for a variety of other antidepressants is generally between 0.1 and 1.5% at recommended dosage levels.

The prescribing information notes that [[hypertension]], sometimes severe, was observed in some people taking bupropion, both with and without pre-existing hypertension. The frequency of this adverse effect was under 1% and not significantly higher than found with placebo. A review of the available data carried out in 2008 indicated that bupropion is safe to use in people with a variety of serious cardiac conditions.

In the UK, more than 7,600 reports of suspected adverse reactions were collected in the first two years after bupropion's approval by the [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]] as part of the [[Yellow Card Scheme]], which monitored side effects. Approximately 540,000 people were treated with bupropion for smoking cessation during that period. The MHRA received 60 reports of &quot;''suspected'' [emphasis MHRA's] adverse reactions to Zyban which had a fatal outcome&quot;. The agency concluded that &quot;in the majority of cases the individual's underlying condition may provide an alternative explanation.&quot;

Suicidal behavior is less of a concern when bupropion is prescribed for smoking cessation. According to a 2014 [[Cochrane Library|Cochrane review]], while there is an association with suicide it is unclear if bupropion was the cause. In 2016 the FDA removed the black box warning about psychiatric problems when used for stopping smoking.

In 2009 the FDA issued a health advisory warning that the prescription of bupropion for smoking cessation has been associated with reports about unusual behavior changes, agitation and hostility. Some people, according to the advisory, have become depressed or have had their depression worsen, have had thoughts about suicide or dying, or have attempted suicide. However, adding a benzodiazepine to treat psychosis, instead of an antipsychotic, may become a valid alternative according to the model of amphetamine-induced psychosis.

The severity of side effects can vary based on the dose and administration route of EE. The estrogen component of oral contraceptives, which is almost always EE, can cause [[breast tenderness]] and [[breast enlargement|fullness]]. In males, EE has additional side effects, including [[gynecomastia]] (breast development), [[feminization (biology)|feminization]] in general, [[hypogonadism]], [[infertility]], and [[sexual dysfunction]] (e.g., reduced [[libido]] and [[erectile dysfunction]]).

===Rare reactions===

====Venous thromboembolism====
EE carries a greater risk of blood clot formation and VTE than does natural estradiol, which is thought to be due to different degrees of hepatic metabolism between the two drugs (see [[#Potency|below]]).

The original formulations of COCs contained as much as 150&amp;nbsp;μg EE. However, it was soon found that EE is associated with incidence of VTE and that the risk is dose-dependent. Subsequently, the dosage of EE was greatly reduced, and is now generally between 25 and 35&amp;nbsp;μg, in some cases less than 20&amp;nbsp;μg, and not more than 50&amp;nbsp;μg. However, discontinuation of OCs are common with doses of estrogen from 10 to 20&amp;nbsp;μg due to its association &quot;with higher rates of bleeding pattern disruptions.&quot;  According to a bulletin posted by the {{abbrlink|U.S.|United States}} {{abbrlink|FDA|Food and Drug Administration}}, the rate of [[deep vein thrombosis]] in women taking COCs containing 20 to 40&amp;nbsp;μg EE is 4 per 10,000, which is approximately equivalent to the rate of 3 per 10,000 in women not taking a COC.

====Cholestatic hepatotoxicity====
EE has, albeit rarely (at the low dosages that are now used in COCs), been associated with [[cholestasis|cholestatic]] [[hepatotoxicity]] similarly to [[17α-alkylated anabolic steroid|17α-alkylated]] [[anabolic–androgenic steroid]]s and 17α-ethynylated [[19-nortestosterone]] progestins. However, the incidence and severity of cholestatic hepatotoxicity appear to be much greater with EE than with estradiol, which is due to its 17α-ethynyl substitution and consequent reduced metabolism. COCs containing dimethisterone have since been discontinued (with more potent progestogens used instead) and doses of EE in COCs in general have been dramatically reduced, abrogating the risk. In turn, most studies of modern COCs have found a decreased risk of endometrial cancer.

Notably, this drug has a low incidence of hair loss ([[alopecia]]) unlike most other chemotherapy drugs.

===Warning===
Bendamustine solution is not compatible with Closed System Transfer Devices (CSTD)
Situation:
* FDA issued a warning on March 11, 2015 not to use bendamustine solution with CSTDs, adapters and syringes which contain either polycarbonate or acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) due to the incompatibility with N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA).
Background:
* PhaSealR &amp; SpirosR CSTDs contain either polycarbonate or ABS can dissolve when coming into contact with bendamustine (which contains DMA).
Assessment:
* This can lead to device failure, possible product contamination, and potential serious adverse health consequences, including skin reactions in health care professionals preparing and administering this product and the risk of small blood vessel blockage in patients.
Recommendations:
* Immediately, stop using all PhaSealR &amp;/or SpirosR products including adapters when preparing &amp; administering bendamustine.
* Only use polypropylene syringes with bendamustine. These syringes are translucent in appearance.
* Continue to use all universal PPE &amp; safety precautions for hazardous drugs when preparing &amp; administering bendamustine.

    <title>Flutamide</title>

The [[side effect]]s of flutamide are [[sex]]-dependent. In men, a variety of side effects related to [[androgen deprivation]] may occur, the most common being [[gynecomastia]] and [[breast tenderness]]. and [[sexual dysfunction]] including reduced [[libido]] and [[erectile dysfunction]]. General side effects that may occur in either sex include [[dizziness]], [[anorexia]], [[gastrointestinal]] side effects such as [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], and [[diarrhea]], a [[Urine#Color|greenish-bluish discoloration]] of the [[urine]], and [[hepatic]] changes.
However, more than 90% of cases of gynecomastia with NSAAs including flutamide are mild to moderate. Moreover, 6% of flutamide-treated patients discontinued the drug due to diarrhea, whereas only 0.5% of bicalutamide-treated patients did so. In the case of antiandrogen monotherapy for prostate cancer, the rates of diarrhea are 5–20% for flutamide, 2–5% for bicalutamide, and 2–4% for [[nilutamide]]. In contrast to diarrhea, the rates of nausea and vomiting are similar among the three drugs.

===Rare reactions===

====Liver toxicity====
Although rare, flutamide has been associated with severe [[hepatotoxicity]] and death. There have been continued case reports since, including [[liver transplant]]s and death. However, other researchers have suggested that the incidence of significant hepatotoxicity may be as high as 6 to 9%. Lower dosages of the drug appear to have a reduced but still significant risk.

The [[mechanism of action]] of flutamide-induced hepatotoxicity is thought to be due to [[mitochondrial toxicity]]. Inhibition of [[taurocholic acid|taurocholate]] (a [[bile acid]]) efflux has also been implicated in flutamide-induced hepatotoxicity. It is thought that the [[nitro compound|nitroaromatic]] [[functional group|group]] of flutamide and hydroxyflutamide enhance their mitochondrial toxicity; bicalutamide, in contrast, possesses a [[cyanide|cyano group]] in place of the nitro [[moiety (chemistry)|moiety]], greatly reducing the potential for such toxicity.

====Others====
Flutamide has also been associated with [[interstitial pneumonitis]] (which can progress to [[pulmonary fibrosis]]). The incidence of interstitial pneumonitis with flutamide was found to be 0.04% (4 per 10,000) in a large clinical cohort of 41,700 prostate cancer patients. Flutamide has been associated with several case reports of [[methemoglobinemia]]. Flutamide has also been associated with reports of [[sulfhemoglobinemia]] and [[neutropenia]].

* [[Lymphopenia]] : Most common in clinical trials was a significant and dose-related reduction of CD4+ and CD8+ counts in 10 to 59% of patients. However, only 0 to 2% of patients experienced reductions below the accepted lower limit. Consequences of lymphopenia may be infections and/or treatment related malignancies (see below).
* Malignancies : In clinical studies among 1,869 patients 63 treatment-emerged malignancies in 43 patients were observed. Most of these were [[nonmelanoma]] and [[melanoma]] [[skin cancer]]s, other [[solid tumor]]s, and [[lymphoma]]s.
* Infections : In clinical studies 0.9% of patients experienced significant infections compared to 0.2% in the placebo group. Among the infections were serious ones such as [[sepsis]], [[pneumonia]], [[abscess]]es, [[wound infection]]s and [[toxic shock syndrome]].
* Sensitivity reactions: [[Urticaria]] and [[angioedema]] were observed. If an [[anaphylactic reaction]] should occur symptomatic treatment should be initiated at once.
* Forming of [[antibody|antibodies]] to alefacept : About 3% of patients developed low-titer antibodies with unknown importance for the clinical efficiency of the drug. Long-term immune effects have not been well explored.
* Hepatic Toxicity : Postmarketing reports revealed asymtomatic increases in [[transaminases]] ([[alanine transaminase|ALT]] and/or [[aspartate transaminase|AST]]), [[fatty liver degeneration]], decompensation of preexisting [[liver cirrhosis]], and acute treatment-related [[liver failure]]. It is not known if some or all of these manifestations are attributable to alefacept-therapy, but it is recommended to discontinue therapy as soon as any sign of liver toxicity develops.
* Different Common Side Effects : side effects such as [[pharyngitis]], [[cough]], [[dizziness]], [[nausea]], [[pruritus]], [[myalgia]]s, [[Rigor (medicine)|chills]], and reactions at injection sites were observed quite frequently.

    <title>Dextromethorphan</title>

Side effects of dextromethorphan at normal therapeutic doses can include:

===Neurotoxicity===
Dextromethorphan had been thought to cause [[Olney's lesions]] when administered [[intravenously]]; however, this was later proven inconclusive, due to lack of research on humans. Tests were performed on rats, giving them 50&amp;nbsp;mg and up every day up to a month. Neurotoxic changes, including vacuolation, have been observed in [[posterior cingulate]] and retrosplenial cortices of rats administered other [[NMDA_receptor_antagonist|NMDA receptor antagonists]] such as PCP, but not with dextromethorphan.

===Dependence and withdrawal===
In many documented cases, dextromethorphan has produced [[substance dependence|psychological dependence]] in people who used it recreationally. However, it does not produce [[substance dependence|physical addiction]], according to the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] Committee on Drug Dependence. It is considered less addictive than the other common weak opiate cough suppressant, [[codeine]]. Since dextromethorphan also acts as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) users describe that regular recreational use over a longer period of time can cause withdrawal symptoms that are similar to those of [[antidepressant discontinuation syndrome]]. Additionally, disturbances have been reported in: sleep, senses, movement, mood, and thinking.

    <title>Pirfenidone</title>


===Gastrointestinal===
Pirfenidone is frequently associated with gastrointestinal side effects such as [[dyspepsia]], [[nausea]], gastritis, [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]] (GERD) and [[vomiting]].To reduce the severity of these reactions, pirfenidone is to be taken after meals.

===Skin===
Pirfenidone is known to cause [[photosensitivity]] reactions, [[rash]], [[pruritus]] and [[dry skin]]. Patients are usually advised to avoid direct exposure to sunlight, including [[sun lamp]]s, and to use protective clothing and [[sunscreening agents]]. Continuing photosensitivity reactions are usually managed by dose adjustment and temporary discontinuation of treatment if required, along with local symptomatic treatment.

===Hepatic dysfunction===
Pirfenidone can increase hepatic enzyme levels, especially those of [[aspartate transaminase]] (AST), [[alanine transaminase]] (ALT) and [[gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase]] (GGT); periodic monitoring of hepatic enzyme levels is required during therapy: once before the initiation of therapy, monthly monitoring until 6 months after initiation of therapy, and 3 monthly thereafter. Extra precaution is required while prescribing the drug in patients with hepatic impairment and in patients who are concomitantly taking a [[CYP1A2]] [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]]. The drug is contraindicated in patients who have severe hepatic impairment.

===Dizziness and fatigue===
[[Dizziness]] and fatigue have been reported in patients undergoing pirfenidone treatment. Dizziness typically resolves, although patients should know how they react to pirfenidone before undertaking activities that need mental alertness or coordination. If severe, dose adjustment or treatment discontinuation may be required.

===Weight loss===
Weight loss has been reported in patients treated with pirfenidone. Doctors should monitor patients’ weight and encourage increased caloric intake if necessary.

    <title>Chloroquine</title>

[[adverse drug reaction|Side effects]] include neuromuscular, hearing,  [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]], [[Central nervous system|brain]], skin, [[eye]], cardiovascular (rare), and blood reactions.
* Deafness or [[tinnitus]].
* Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and anorexia.
* Mild and transient headache.
* Skin [[itch]]iness, skin color changes, hair loss, and skin rashes. 
** Chloroquine-induced itching is very common among black Africans (70%), but much less common in other races. It increases with age, and is so severe as to stop compliance with drug therapy. It is increased during malaria fever; its severity is correlated to the malaria parasite load in blood. Some evidence indicates it has a genetic basis and is related to chloroquine action with opiate receptors centrally or peripherally.
* Unpleasant metallic taste
** This could be avoided by ‘taste-masked and controlled release’ formulations such as multiple emulsions.
* [[Chloroquine retinopathy]]
** May be irreversible. This occurs with long-term use over many years or with high doses. Patients on long-term chloroquine therapy should be screened at baseline and then annually after five years of use. The daily safe maximum doses for eye toxicity can be computed from one's height and weight using this calculator.
* Hypotension and electrocardiographic changes  It is still advised to prevent women who are pregnant or planning on getting pregnant from traveling to malaria-risk regions.

=== Elderly ===
There is not enough evidence to determine whether chloroquine is safe to be given to people aged 65 and older. However, the drug is cleared by the kidneys and toxicity should be monitored carefully in people with poor kidney functions.

    <title>Escitalopram</title>

{{See also|List of adverse effects for escitalopram}}
Escitalopram, like other [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRIs]], has been shown to affect sexual functions causing side effects such as decreased [[libido]], [[delayed ejaculation]], and [[anorgasmia]]. Their use during pregnancy should thus be balanced against that of depression.

===Overdose===
Excessive doses of escitalopram usually cause relatively minor untoward effects such as agitation and [[tachycardia]]. However, [[dyskinesia]], [[hypertonia]], and [[clonus]] may occur in some cases. Plasma escitalopram concentrations are usually in a range of 20–80 μg/L in therapeutic situations and may reach 80–200 μg/L in the elderly, patients with hepatic dysfunction, those who are poor CYP2C19 metabolizers or following acute overdose. Monitoring of the drug in plasma or serum is generally accomplished using chromatographic methods. Chiral techniques are available to distinguish escitalopram from its racemate, citalopram. Escitalopram seems to be less dangerous than [[citalopram]] in overdose and comparable to other SSRIs.

Agomelatine does not alter daytime [[vigilance (psychology)|vigilance]] and [[memory]] in healthy volunteers. In depressed patients, treatment with the drug increased [[Slow-wave sleep|slow wave]] sleep without modification of REM ([[Rapid eye movement sleep|Rapid Eye Movement]]) sleep amount or REM latency. Agomelatine also induced an advance of the time of sleep onset and of minimum heart rate. From the first week of treatment, onset of sleep and the quality of sleep were significantly improved without daytime clumsiness as assessed by patients.

Agomelatine appears to cause fewer [[SSRI#Sexual dysfunction|sexual side effects]] and [[discontinuation]] effects than paroxetine. It appears better tolerated than the [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors|SSRIs]].

[[Adverse drug reaction]]s (ADRs) are rare when it is administered correctly. Most ADRs relate to administration technique (resulting in systemic exposure) or pharmacological effects of anesthesia, however [[allergy|allergic]] reactions can rarely occur.

Systemic exposure to excessive quantities of ropivacaine mainly result in [[central nervous system]] (CNS) and [[cardiovascular]] effects – CNS effects usually occur at lower [[blood plasma]] concentrations and additional cardiovascular effects present at higher concentrations, though cardiovascular collapse may also occur with low concentrations. CNS effects may include CNS excitation (nervousness, tingling around the mouth, [[tinnitus]], tremor, dizziness, blurred vision, [[seizure]]s followed by depression (drowsiness, loss of consciousness), [[respiratory depression]] and [[apnea]]). Cardiovascular effects include [[hypotension]], [[bradycardia]], [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]]s, and/or [[cardiac arrest]] – some of which may be due to [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxemia]] secondary to respiratory depression.

===Postarthroscopic glenohumeral chondrolysis===
Ropivacaine is toxic to [[cartilage]] and their intra-articular infusions can lead to [[Postarthroscopic glenohumeral chondrolysis]].

===Treatment of overdose===
As for [[bupivacaine]], [[Intralipid|Celepid]], a commonly available intravenous lipid emulsion, can be effective in treating severe cardiotoxicity secondary to local anaesthetic overdose in animal experiments and in humans in a process called [[Lipid rescue#Management|lipid rescue]].

    <title>Caffeine</title>


===Physical===

Caffeine can increase blood pressure and cause [[vasoconstriction]]. However, acute ingestion of caffeine in large doses (at least 250–300&amp;nbsp;mg, equivalent to the amount found in 2–3 cups of coffee or 5–8 cups of tea) results in a short-term stimulation of urine output in individuals who have been deprived of caffeine for a period of days or weeks.Since this observation was first published, caffeine addiction has been added as an official diagnosis in ICDM&amp;nbsp;9. This decision is disputed by many and is not supported by any convincing body of experimental evidence.&amp;nbsp;... All of these observations strongly suggest that caffeine does not act on the dopaminergic structures related to addiction, nor does it improve performance by alleviating any symptoms of withdrawal}}&lt;/ref&gt;F15&amp;nbsp;Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of other stimulants, including caffeine&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.2&amp;nbsp;Dependence syndrome&lt;br /&gt;A cluster of behavioural, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and that typically include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal state.&lt;br /&gt;The dependence syndrome may be present for a specific psychoactive substance (e.g., tobacco, alcohol, or diazepam), for a class of substances (e.g., opioid drugs), or for a wider range of pharmacologically different psychoactive substances. [Includes:]&lt;br /&gt;Chronic alcoholism&lt;br /&gt;Dipsomania&lt;br /&gt;Drug addiction}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s {{nowrap|[[DSM-5]]}} does not include the diagnosis of a ''caffeine addiction'' but proposes criteria for the disorder for more study. Mild to increasingly severe [[physical dependence]] and withdrawal symptoms may occur upon abstinence, with greater than 100&amp;nbsp;mg caffeine per day; some symptoms associated with [[psychological dependence]] may also occur during [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]]. Caffeine dependence can involve withdrawal symptoms such as fatigue, headache, irritability, depressed mood, reduced contentedness, inability to concentrate, sleepiness or drowsiness, [[abdominal pain|stomach pain]], and [[arthralgia|joint pain]]. The [[American Psychiatric Association|APA]], which published the DSM-5, acknowledged that there was sufficient evidence in order to create a diagnostic model of caffeine dependence for the DSM-5, but they noted that the [[clinical significance]] of this disorder is unclear. The DSM-5 instead lists &quot;caffeine use disorder&quot; in the [[DSM-5#Section III: emerging measures and models|emerging models]] section of the manual.

[[Drug tolerance|Tolerance]] varies for daily, regular caffeine users and high caffeine users. High doses of caffeine (750 to 1200&amp;nbsp;mg/day spread throughout the day) have been shown to produce complete tolerance to some, but not all of the effects of caffeine. Doses as low as 100&amp;nbsp;mg/day, such as a 6 oz cup of coffee or two to three 12 oz servings of caffeinated soft-drink, may continue to cause sleep disruption, among other intolerances. Non-regular caffeine users have the least caffeine tolerance for sleep disruption. Some coffee drinkers develop tolerance to its undesired sleep-disrupting effects, but others apparently do not.

===Risk of other diseases===
{{See also|Coffee#Health and pharmacology}}

A protective effect of caffeine against [[Alzheimer's disease]] is possible, but the evidence is inconclusive. Caffeine increases [[intraocular pressure]] in those with [[glaucoma]] but does not appear to affect normal individuals. It may protect people from [[liver cirrhosis]]. Caffeine may lessen the severity of [[acute mountain sickness]] if taken a few hours prior to attaining a high altitude.

    <title>Nicotine</title>

Limited data exists on the health effects of long-term use of pure nicotine, because nicotine is usually consumed via [[tobacco]] products. The long-term use of nicotine in the form of snus incurs a slight risk of cardiovascular disease compared to tobacco smoking and is not associated with cancer. Studies of continued use of [[nicotine replacement products]] in those who have stopped smoking found no [[adverse effect]]s from months to several years, and that people with [[cardiovascular disease]] were able to tolerate them for 12 weeks. Experimental research suggests that adolescent nicotine use may harm [[brain development]]. Children exposed to nicotine may have a number of lifelong health issues.

===Metabolism and body weight===
By reducing the [[appetite]] and raising the [[metabolism]], some smokers may [[weight loss|lose weight]] as a consequence.  By increasing metabolic rate and inhibiting the usual compensatory increase in appetite, the body weight of smokers is lower on average than that of non-smokers. When smokers quit, they gain on average 5–6&amp;nbsp;kg weight, returning to the average weight of non-smokers.

===Vascular system===
Human epidemiology studies show that nicotine use is not a significant cause of cardiovascular disease. A 2016 review suggests that &quot;the risks of nicotine without tobacco combustion products (cigarette smoke) are low compared to cigarette smoking, but are still of concern in people with cardiovascular disease.&quot; Prolonged nicotine use seems not to increase atherosclerosis. Brief nicotine use, such as nicotine medicine, seems to incur a slight cardiovascular risk, even to people with established cardiovascular disease. A 2015 review found &quot;Nicotine ''in vitro'' and in animal models can inhibit [[apoptosis]] and enhance [[angiogenesis]], effects that raise concerns about the role of nicotine in promoting the acceleration of atherosclerotic disease.&quot; A [[meta-analysis]] shows that [[snus]] consumption, which delivers nicotine at a dose equivalent to that of cigarettes, is not associated with [[heart attacks]]. Nicotine increases heart rate and blood pressure but a 2015 review found it may elevate serum cholesterol levels. Many quitting smoking studies using nicotine medicines report lowered [[dyslipidemia]] with considerable benefit in HDL/LDL ratios. Nicotine supports clot formation and aids in plaque formation by enhancing [[vascular smooth muscle]].

===Cancer===
[[File:Side effects of nicotine.png|thumb|330px|Possible [[side effect]]s of nicotine.]]
Although there is insufficient evidence to classify nicotine as a [[carcinogen]], there is an ongoing debate about whether it functions as a [[tumor promoter]]. ''[[In vitro]]'' studies have associated it with cancer, but carcinogenicity has not been demonstrated ''[[in vivo]]''. There is inadequate research to demonstrate that nicotine is associated with cancer in humans, but there is evidence indicating possible oral, esophageal, or pancreatic cancer risks. Nicotine replacement products have not been shown to be associated with cancer in the real world. Nicotine negatively affects pregnancy outcomes and fetal brain development. Risks to the child later in life via nicotine exposure during pregnancy include type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, neurobehavioral defects, respiratory dysfunction, and infertility.

Nicotine is highly [[addictive]], Nicotine activates the [[mesolimbic pathway]] and induces long-term [[ΔFosB]] expression in the [[nucleus accumbens]] when inhaled or injected at sufficiently high doses, but not necessarily when ingested.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions&lt;br /&gt;ΔFosB is an essential transcription factor implicated in the molecular and behavioral pathways of addiction following repeated drug exposure. The formation of ΔFosB in multiple brain regions, and the molecular pathway leading to the formation of AP-1 complexes is well understood. The establishment of a functional purpose for ΔFosB has allowed further determination as to some of the key aspects of its molecular cascades, involving effectors such as GluR2 (87,88), Cdk5 (93) and NFkB (100). Moreover, many of these molecular changes identified are now directly linked to the structural, physiological and behavioral changes observed following chronic drug exposure (60,95,97,102). New frontiers of research investigating the molecular roles of ΔFosB have been opened by epigenetic studies, and recent advances have illustrated the role of ΔFosB acting on DNA and histones, truly as a ‘‘molecular switch’’ (34). As a consequence of our improved understanding of ΔFosB in addiction, it is possible to evaluate the addictive potential of current medications (119), as well as use it as a biomarker for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions (121,122,124).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In dependent smokers, smoking during withdrawal returns cognitive abilities to pre-withdrawal levels, but chronic use may not offer cognitive benefits over not smoking.

===Use of other drugs===
{{main article|Tobacco and other drugs}}
{{See also|Gateway drug theory}}
In animals it is relatively simple to determine if consumption of a certain drug increases the later attraction of another drug. In humans, where such direct experiments are not possible, [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]] can show if the probability of a substance use is related to earlier use of other substances.

In mice nicotine increased the probability of later consumption of [[cocaine]] and the experiments permitted concrete conclusions on the underlying [[Molecular biology|molecular biological]] alteration in the brain. The biological changes in mice correspond to the [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] observations in humans that nicotine consumption is coupled to an increased probability of later use of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and cocaine.

In rats cannabis consumption – earlier in life – increased the later self-administration of nicotine. A study of drug use of 14,577 US 12th graders showed that alcohol consumption was associated with an increased probability of later use of tobacco, cannabis, and other illegal drugs.

    <title>Diacerein</title>

The most common [[adverse drug reaction|side effects]] of diacerein treatment are [[gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] symptoms including soft stools and [[diarrhea]]. These are generally mild to moderate and occur more frequently in the first 2 weeks, and lessen with continued treatment. Based on review by European Medicines Agency (EMA), diacerein-containing medicines use is restricted due to severe diarrhoea and liver disorders in patients.

An uncommon side effect is hepatic adverse events (most frequently reported as liver function test abnormalities). These have been described as mild/moderate cases of elevated liver enzymes in the blood.

Mild skin reactions (rash, pruritus and eczema) have also been reported with diacerein treatment. 

Discoloration of urine (yellow or pink) is another side effect of diacerein. This effect is due to the elimination of rhein metabolites via the urine and no clinical significance has been found; it may also be dependent on general fluid intake.

Side effects can involve the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and the central nervous system. Compared to other antibiotics some studies find a higher rate of side effects Ciprofloxacin was stopped because of an adverse event in 1% of people treated with the medication by mouth. The most frequently reported drug-related events, from trials of all formulations, all dosages, all drug-therapy durations, and for all indications, were nausea (2.5%), diarrhea (1.6%), abnormal liver function tests (1.3%), vomiting (1%), and rash (1%). Other adverse events occurred at rates of &lt;1%.

===Tendinitis===
The [[Boxed warning|black box warning]] on the U.S. FDA-approved ciprofloxacin label warns of an increased risk of [[tendinitis]] and tendon rupture, especially in people who are older than 60 years, people who also use corticosteroids, and people with kidney, lung, or heart transplants. Tendon rupture can occur during therapy or even months after discontinuation of the medication. A [[case-control study]] performed using a UK medical care database found that fluoroquinolone use was associated with a 1.9-fold increase in tendon problems. The relative risk increased to 3.2 in those over 60 years of age and to 6.2 in those over the age of 60 who were also taking corticosteroids. Among the 46,766 quinolone users in the study, 38 (0.1%) cases of Achilles tendon rupture were identified. A study performed using an Italian healthcare database reached qualitatively similar conclusions.

===Nervous system===
The 2013 FDA label warns of nervous system effects. Ciprofloxacin, like other fluoroquinolones, is known to trigger seizures or lower the seizure threshold, and may cause other central nervous system side effects. Headache, dizziness, and insomnia have been reported as occurring fairly commonly in postapproval review articles, along with a much lower incidence of serious CNS side effects such as tremors, psychosis, anxiety, hallucinations, paranoia, and suicide attempts, especially at higher doses. Like other fluoroquinolones, it is also known to cause peripheral neuropathy that may be irreversible, such as weakness, burning pain, tingling or numbness.

===Cancer===
Ciprofloxacin is active in six of eight ''in vitro'' assays used as rapid screens for the detection of genotoxic effects, but is not active in ''in vivo'' assays of genotoxicity. Long-term carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice resulted in no carcinogenic or tumorigenic effects due to ciprofloxacin at daily oral dose levels up to 250 and 750&amp;nbsp;mg/kg to rats and mice, respectively (about 1.7 and 2.5 times the highest recommended therapeutic dose based upon mg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Results from photo co-carcinogenicity testing indicate ciprofloxacin does not reduce the time to appearance of UV-induced skin tumors as compared to vehicle control.

===Other===
The other black box warning is that ciprofloxacin should not be used in people with [[myasthenia gravis]] due to possible exacerbation of muscle weakness which may lead to breathing problems resulting in death or ventilator support. Fluoroquinolones are known to block neuromuscular transmission.

''[[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|Clostridium difficile]]''-associated diarrhea is a serious adverse effect of ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones; it is unclear whether the risk is higher than with other broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Children and the elderly are at a much greater risk of experiencing adverse reactions.

{{See also|Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome}}

===Common===
Side effects typical of hypnotic benzodiazepines are related to CNS depression, and include [[somnolence]], sedation, drunkenness, [[dizziness]], [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[ataxia]], [[headache]], [[lethargy]], impairment of [[memory]] and [[learning]], longer [[reaction time]] and impairment of motor functions (including [[motor coordination|coordination]] problems), In 1979, the Institute of Medicine (USA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse stated that most hypnotics lose their sleep-inducing properties after about three to 14 days. In use longer than one to two weeks, tolerance will rapidly develop towards the ability of temazepam to maintain sleep, resulting in a loss of effectiveness. Some studies have observed tolerance to temazepam after as little as one week's use. Another study examined the short-term effects of the accumulation of temazepam over seven days in elderly inpatients, and found little tolerance developed during the accumulation of the drug. Other studies examined the use of temazepam over six days and saw no evidence of tolerance. A study in 11 young male subjects showed significant tolerance occurs to temazepam's thermoregulatory effects and sleep inducing properties after one week of use of 30-mg temazepam. Body temperature is well correlated with the sleep-inducing or insomnia-promoting properties of drugs.

In one study, the drug sensitivity of people who had used temazepam for one to 20 years was no different from that of controls. An additional study, in which at least one of the authors is employed by multiple drug companies, examined the efficacy of temazepam treatment on chronic insomnia over three months, and saw no drug tolerance, with the authors even suggesting the drug might become more effective over time.

Establishing continued efficacy beyond a few weeks can be complicated by the difficulty in distinguishing between the return of the original insomnia complaint and withdrawal or rebound related insomnia. Sleep [[EEG]] studies on hypnotic benzodiazepines show tolerance tends to occur completely after one to four weeks with sleep EEG returning to pretreatment levels. The paper concluded, due to concerns about long-term use both toxicity and tolerance and dependence, as well as controversy over long-term efficacy, wise prescribers should restrict benzodiazepines to a few weeks and avoid continuing prescriptions for months or years. A review of the literature found the nonpharmacological treatment options were a more effective treatment option for insomnia due to their sustained improvements in sleep quality.

===Physical dependence===

Temazepam, like other [[benzodiazepine]] drugs, can cause [[physical dependence]] and [[Substance use disorder|addiction]]. Withdrawal from temazepam or other benzodiazepines after regular use often leads to a [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]], which resembles symptoms during alcohol and [[barbiturate]] withdrawal. The higher the dose and the longer the drug is taken, the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can also occur from standard dosages and after short-term use. Abrupt withdrawal from therapeutic doses of temazepam after long-term use may result in a severe [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]]. Gradual and careful reduction of the dosage, preferably with a long-acting benzodiazepine with long half-life [[active metabolites]], such as [[chlordiazepoxide]] or [[diazepam]], are recommended to prevent severe withdrawal syndromes from developing. Other hypnotic benzodiazepines are not recommended. A study in rats found temazepam is [[cross tolerant]] with barbiturates and is able to effectively substitute for barbiturates and suppress barbiturate withdrawal signs.
Rare cases are reported in the medical literature of psychotic states developing after abrupt withdrawal from benzodiazepines, even from therapeutic doses. Antipsychotics increase the severity of benzodiazepine withdrawal effects with an increase in the intensity and severity of convulsions.
Patients who were treated in the hospital with temazepam or [[nitrazepam]] have continued taking these after leaving the hospital. Hypnotic uses in the hospital were recommended to be limited to five nights' use only, to avoid the development of withdrawal symptoms such as insomnia.

As with many of the atypical antipsychotics, blonanserin can elicit cardio metabolic risks. While the side effects of blonanserin – such as weight gain, cholesterol and [[triglyceride]] levels, [[glucose]] levels and other blood lipid levels – do not differ greatly from other atypical antipsychotics, the specificity of blonanserin appears to elicit milder side effects, with less weight gain in particular.

[[Side effect]]s of the oral formulation include itching, nausea, and vomiting. &gt;10% of patients using the oral formulation may have [[Liver function tests|abnormal liver function tests]]. Side effects include rash, hives, blisters, burning, itching, peeling, redness, swelling, pain or other signs of skin irritation. For this reason, [[liver function tests]] should be monitored periodically when taking the oral clotrimazole (troche). When used to treat [[Yeast infection|vulvovaginal candidiasis (yeast infection)]], &lt;10% of patient have vulvar or vaginal burning sensation. &lt;1% of patients have the following side effects: Burning or itching of penis of sexual partner; [[polyuria]]; vulvar itching, soreness, edema, or discharge  

    <title>Clofazimine</title>

Clofazimine produces pink to brownish skin pigmentation in 75-100% of patients within a few weeks, as well as similar discoloration of most bodily fluids and secretions. These discolorations are reversible but may take months to years to disappear. There is evidence in medical literature that as a result of clofazimine administration, several patients have developed [[Depression (mood)|depression]] which in some cases resulted in suicide. It has been hypothesized that the depression was a result of this chronic skin discoloration.

Cases of [[icthyosis]] and skin dryness are also reported in response to this drug (8%-28%), as well as rash and itchiness (1-5%).

40-50% of patients develop gastrointestinal intolerance. Rarely, patients have died from bowel obstructions and intestinal bleeding, or required abdominal surgery to correct the same problem.

    <title>Omalizumab</title>

The main adverse effect is [[anaphylaxis]] (a life-threatening systemic allergic reaction), with a rate of occurrence of 1 to 2 patients per 1,000. Like other protein and antibody drugs, omalizumab also causes anaphylaxis, although at a relatively low frequency among antibody drugs. The allergic reaction is probably not due to the binding characteristics of the antibody drug, but to the protein nature of the antibody{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}. The patients who use omalizumab are generally highly allergic. Thus, even though the drug is administered with the purpose to suppress allergy (including anaphylactic reactions), it does not work immediately after injection.

It also increases the risk of [[stroke]]s and [[heart disease]] by a small amount. To clarify this imbalance, a more recent study was performed based on pooled analysis using much more comprehensive data from 67 phase I to IV clinical trials. The prespecified primary analysis assessed the incidence of primary malignancy in 32 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (RDBPC) trials. In this analysis, there were 11,459 unique patients in all clinical trials (7,789 received omalizumab). The primary analysis identified malignancies in 25 patients (RDBPC trials): 14 in 4,254 omalizumab-treated patients and 11 in 3,178 placebo-treated patients. Incidence rates per 1,000 patient-years of observation time for omalizumab- and placebo-treated patients were 4.14 (95% CI, 2.26-6.94) and 4.45 (95% CI, 2.22-7.94), respectively; the corresponding rate ratio was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.39-2.27). Primary malignancies were of varying [[histologic]] type and occurred in a number of different organ systems; no cluster of histologies was identified. The study thus concluded that in this pooled analysis no association was observed between omalizumab treatment and risk of malignancy in RDBPC trials; the rate ratio was below unity. The data suggest that a causal relationship between omalizumab therapy and malignancy is unlikely.

Concerns were raised earlier about possible induction of [[eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis]] (Churg-Strauss syndrome), a rare form of systemic [[vasculitis]] associated with asthma, in patients receiving the drug. A retrospective review, which identified and analyzed cases of Churg-Strauss syndrome using the Novartis Argus global drug safety database for omalizumab in asthma patients, has indicated that Churg-Strauss syndrome may develop in patients who have an underlying [[eosinophilic]] disorder that is unmasked by the withdrawal of corticosteroids, which is common among patients receiving this treatment.

===Contraindications===
Contraindications include:
* [[Hypervitaminosis D|Vitamin D intoxication]]
* [[Hypercalcaemia]]
* Hypersensitivity to paricalcitol or any of its excipients

whereas cautions include:
* Impaired liver function
* It is also advised that physicians regularly monitor their patients' [[calcium]] and [[phosphorus]] levels.

===Interactions===
Drugs that may interact with paricalcitol include: 
{{colbegin|2}}
* [[Ketoconazole]], as it may interfere with paricalcitol's metabolism in the liver.
* [[Digitoxin]], hypercalcaemia due to any cause can exacerbate the toxicity of digitoxin.
* [[Thiazide]] diuretics or calcium supplements as [[hypercalcaemia]] may be induced by this combination
* [[Magnesium]]-containing products such as [[antacids]] may increase the risk of [[hypermagnesemia]].
* [[Aluminium]]-containing products such as antacids may increase the risk of [[aluminium toxicity]].
* Drugs that interfere with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, such as [[cholestyramine]] may interfere with the absorption of paricalcitol. 
{{colend}}

===Overdose===
Electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. [[hypercalcaemia]] and [[hyperphosphataemia]]) are common overdose symptoms. Treatment is mostly supportive, with particular attention being paid to correcting electrolyte anomalies and reducing intake of calcium in both the form of supplementation and diet. As it is so heavily bound to plasma proteins [[haemodialysis]] is unlikely to be helpful in cases of overdose.

Early symptoms of overdose can include:
{{colbegin|4}}
* Weakness
* Headache
* Somnolence
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Dry mouth
* Constipation
* Muscle pain
* Bone pain
* Metallic taste in the mouth.
{{colend}}
It is worth noting, however, that may of these symptoms are also indicative of kidney failure and hence may be masked by the patient's condition.

Late symptoms of overdose include:
{{colbegin|4}}
* [[Anorexia (symptom)|Loss of appetite]]
* Weight loss
* [[Conjunctivitis]] (calcific)
* [[Pancreatitis]]
* Photophobia
* Rhinorrhoea
* Pruritus
* Hyperthermia
* Decreased libido
* Elevated BUN
* Hypercholesterolaemia
* Elevated AST and ALT
* Ectopic calcification
* Hypertension
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Somnolence
* Death
* Psychosis (rare)

Common adverse effects include:
* [[oropharyngeal]] pain

Less common adverse effects include:
* musculoskeletal pain
* neck pain
* muscle spasms 
* extremity pain 
* muscle fatigue
* anaphylaxis
* [[malignancy]]

The most common adverse effect of reslizumab was oropharyngeal (mouth and throat) pain. According to the phase III clinical trials data, oropharyngeal pain occurred in ≥2% of individuals along with elevated baseline creatine phosphokinase (CPK), which was more common in patients treated with reslizumab versus placebo. Myalgia was also reported more in patients in the reslizumab 3&amp;nbsp;mg/kg group versus the placebo group as well as some musculoskeletal adverse reactions. Lastly, some serious adverse reactions that occurred in subjects treated with reslizumab but not in those treated with placebo included anaphylaxis and malignancy.

[[File:Rational scale to assess the harm of drugs (mean physical harm and mean dependence).svg|thumb|upright=1.3|A 2007 assessment of harm from recreational drug use (mean physical harm and mean dependence liability). Buprenorphine was ranked 9th in dependence, 8th in physical harm, and 11th in social harm.]]

Common [[adverse drug reaction]]s associated with the use of buprenorphine are similar to those of other opioids and include: nausea and vomiting, drowsiness, dizziness, headache, memory loss, cognitive and neural inhibition, perspiration, itchiness, dry mouth, shrinking of the pupils of the eyes ([[miosis]]), [[orthostatic hypotension]], male ejaculatory difficulty, decreased libido, and [[urinary retention]]. [[Constipation]] and CNS effects are seen less frequently than with morphine. It occurs more often in those who are also taking [[benzodiazepine]]s, [[ethanol|alcohol]], or have underlying lung disease. The usual reversal agents for opioids, such as [[naloxone]], may be only partially effective and additional efforts to support breathing may be required. Respiratory depression may be less than with other opioids, particularly with chronic use.

===Pain management===
People on high-dose buprenorphine therapy may be unaffected by even large doses of opioids such as [[oxycodone]], [[morphine]], or [[hydromorphone]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

It is also difficult to achieve acute opioid [[analgesia]] in persons using buprenorphine for opioid replacement therapy.

    <title>Dabigatran</title>


The most commonly reported side effect of dabigatran is gastrointestinal upset. When compared to people anticoagulated with warfarin, patients taking dabigatran had fewer life-threatening bleeds, fewer minor and major bleeds, including intracranial bleeds, but the rate of gastrointestinal bleeding was significantly higher. Dabigatran capsules contain tartaric acid, which lowers the gastric pH and is required for adequate absorption. The lower pH has previously been associated with [[dyspepsia]]; some hypothesize that this plays a role in the increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

A small but significantly increased risk of myocardial infarctions (heart attacks) has been noted when combining the safety outcome data from multiple trials.

Reduced doses should be used in those with poor kidney function.

The side effects of alverine include:

*Difficulties in breathing or shortness of breath, wheezing, swelling of the face or other parts of the body (associated with serious [[allergic reaction]]
*Yellowing of the whites of the eyes and the skin, due to liver inflammation
* A feeling of nausea or dizziness
* Headache
* Minor allergic reaction (skin rash/itching)

Due to concerns about the risk of [[hepatotoxicity|liver toxicity]], nimesulide has been withdrawn from market in several countries (Spain, Finland, Belgium, and Ireland). Liver problems have resulted in both deaths and the need for transplantation. This may occur in as little as three days after starting the medication.

Continuous use of nimesulide (more than 15 days) may cause the following side effects:{{medcn|date=June 2014}}
* Diarrhea
* Vomiting
* Skin rash
* Itchiness
* Dizziness
* Bitterness in mouth
Women should use the drug with caution during lactation; Nimesulide is contraindicated during pregnancy.

Brompheniramine's effects on the cholinergic system may include side-effects such as drowsiness, sedation, dry mouth, dry throat, blurred vision, and increased heart rate.  It is listed as one of the drugs of highest anticholinergic activity in a study of anticholinergenic burden, including long-term cognitive impairment.

    <title>Belimumab</title>

Common adverse effects reported with belimumab include nausea, diarrhea, fever, as well as hypersensitivity and infusion-site reactions (severe in 0.9% of patients). It is suggested that patients be treated with an [[antihistamine]] prior to a belimumab infusion.

A greater number of serious infections and deaths were reported in patients treated with belimumab than in those treated with [[placebo]]. Infections are due to the immunosuppressant properties of the drug.

    <title>Trazodone</title>

{{See also|List of adverse effects of trazodone}}

Because of its lack of [[anticholinergic]] side effects, trazodone is especially useful in situations in which [[antimuscarinic]] effects are particularly problematic (e.g., in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia, closed-angle glaucoma, or severe constipation). Trazodone's propensity to cause sedation is a dual-edged sword. For many patients, the relief from agitation, anxiety, and insomnia can be rapid; for other patients, including those individuals with considerable [[psychomotor retardation]] and feelings of low energy, therapeutic doses of trazodone may not be tolerable because of sedation. Trazodone elicits [[orthostatic hypotension]] in some patients, probably as a consequence of α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-adrenergic receptor blockade. Mania has been observed in association with trazodone treatment, including in patients with bipolar disorder, as well as in patients with previous diagnoses of major depression.
Compared to the reversible MAOI antidepressant drug [[moclobemide]], significantly more impairment of vigilance occurs with trazodone.

===Cardiac arrhythmia===
Case reports have noted cardiac arrhythmias emerging in relation to trazodone treatment, both in patients with pre-existing mitral valve prolapse and in patients with negative personal and family histories of cardiac disease.

===Other===
Rare cases of idiosyncratic [[hepatotoxicity]] have been observed, possibly due to the formation of reactive metabolites.

Elevated [[prolactin]] concentrations have been observed in patients taking trazodone.

Mebendazole sometimes causes diarrhea, abdominal pain, and elevated liver enzymes.  In rare cases, it has been associated with a dangerously low white blood cell count, [[thrombocytopenia|low platelet count]], and hair loss, with a risk of [[agranulocytosis]] in rare cases

===Drug interactions===
[[Carbamazepine]] and [[phenytoin]] lower serum levels of mebendazole. [[Cimetidine]] does not appreciably raise serum mebendazole (in contrast to the similar drug [[albendazole]]), consistent with its poor systemic absorption.

* [[alopecia|hair loss]]
* pain and or burning at the IV site
* [[constipation]] or [[diarrhea]]
* [[parageusia|metallic food taste]]
* [[Bone marrow]] suppression, leading to:
** decreased [[white blood cell]] counts (leading to increased susceptibility to [[infection]]s)
** low [[red blood cell]] counts ([[anemia]])
** low [[platelet]] counts (leading to easy bruising and bleeding)

Less common are:
* [[nausea]] and vomiting

* [[fever]], often occurring shortly after IV administration and not due to [[infection]]
* [[mouth ulcer|mouth sores]]
* [[Acute myeloid leukemia]] (which ironically can be treated with etoposide itself)

    <title>Carbimazole</title>

Whilst [[rash]]es and [[pruritus]] are common, these can often be treated with [[antihistamine]]s without stopping the carbimazole. For those patients where sensitivity reactions can not be controlled, [[propylthiouracil]] may be used as an alternative; cross-sensitivity between these drugs is rare.

Its most serious rare side effect is [[bone marrow suppression]] causing [[neutropenia]] and [[agranulocytosis]]. This may occur at any stage during treatment and without warning; monitoring of white cell count is not useful. Patients are advised to immediately report symptoms of infection, such as [[Pharyngitis|sore throat]] or fever, so that a [[full blood count]] test may be arranged. If this confirms a low neutrophil count, discontinuation of the drug leads to recovery. However failure to report suggestive symptoms or delays in  considering the possibility of immunosuppression and its testing, can lead to fatalities.

Common side effects included decreased appetite (9% under rolapitant vs. 7% under placebo), [[neutropenia]] (9% vs. 8% or 7% vs. 6%, depending on the kind of chemotherapy), dizziness (6% vs. 4%), indigestion and [[stomatitis]] (both 4% vs. 2%).

    <title>Eptifibatide</title>

{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
Patients receiving eptifibatide are typically seriously ill and most of them are concomitantly treated with other drugs known to have the potential to cause significant [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]]s. Therefore, not all side effects listed as follows may be attributable to eptifibatide treatment alone:

The major adverse event in the PURSUIT study was severe [[bleeding]]. Bleeding occurred as well at sites of clinical intervention (local sites) as at other sites (systemically) like urogenital bleedings. Sometimes, these events were severe enough to require [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]] of blood or plasma concentrates to stop bleeding and counteract [[anemia]]. Severe bleedings occurred in 4.4 and 4.7% of patients respectively depending on the infusion rate (0.5&amp;nbsp;µg/kg/min vs. 0.75&amp;nbsp;µg/kg/min). A few cases of death due to severe bleeding events attributable to drug therapy were reported. No cases of hemorrhagic stroke were seen. Thrombocytopenia of unknown origin (allergic reaction?) was also noticed in 0.2% of patients.

Additionally, [[hypotension]] was seen frequently (6%). Cardiovascular failure was also frequent (2%) as were serious arrhythmias (ventricular fibrillation 1.5%, atrial fibrillation 6%). Severe allergic (anaphylactic) reactions occurred in almost 0.2% of patients. These reactions can be life-threatening and may be due to the peptide character of eptifibatide. Other side effects were rare and mild in nature and may not be connected to eptifibatide therapy.

    <title>Amantadine</title>

Amantadine has been associated with several [[central nervous system]] (CNS) side effects, likely due to amantadine's [[dopaminergic]] and [[adrenergic]] activity, and to a lesser extent, its activity as an [[anticholinergic]]. CNS side effects include nervousness, anxiety, agitation, insomnia, difficulty in concentrating, and exacerbations of pre-existing seizure disorders and psychiatric symptoms in patients with [[schizophrenia]] or Parkinson's disease. The usefulness of amantadine as an anti-parkinsonian drug is somewhat limited by the need to screen patients for a history of seizures and psychiatric symptoms.

Rare cases of severe skin rashes, such as [[Stevens-Johnson syndrome]], and of [[suicidal ideation]] have also been reported in patients treated with amantadine.

[[Livedo reticularis]] is a possible side effect of amantadine use for Parkinson's disease.

Bevacizumab inhibits the growth of blood vessels, which is part of the body's normal healing and maintenance. The body grows new blood vessels in [[wound healing]], and as [[collateral circulation]] around blocked or [[atherosclerosis|atherosclerotic]] blood vessels. One concern is that bevacizumab will interfere with these normal processes, and worsen conditions like [[coronary artery disease]] or [[peripheral artery disease]].

The main side effects are [[hypertension]] and heightened risk of [[bleeding]]. [[Bowel perforation]] has been reported. Fatigue and infection are also common.
In advanced lung cancer, less than half of patients qualify for treatment. [[Nasal septum perforation]] and renal [[thrombotic microangiopathy]] have been reported. In December 2010, the FDA warned of the risk of developing perforations in the body, including in the nose, stomach, and intestines.

In 2013, Hoffmann-La Roche announced that the drug was associated with 52 cases of [[necrotizing fasciitis]] from 1997 to 2012, of which 17 patients died. About 2/3 of cases involved patients with [[colorectal cancer]], or patients with [[gastrointestinal perforation]]s or [[fistula]]s.

These effects are largely avoided in [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmological]] use since the drug is introduced directly into the eye thus minimizing any effects on the rest of the body.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

    <title>Sibutramine</title>

A higher number of [[cardiovascular events]] has been observed in people taking sibutramine versus control (11.4% vs. 10.0%).  In 2010 the FDA noted the concerns that sibutramine increases the risk of [[heart attacks]] and [[strokes]] in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease.

Frequently encountered [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]]s are: dry mouth, paradoxically increased appetite, [[nausea]], [[dysgeusia|strange taste in the mouth]], upset stomach, constipation, trouble sleeping, dizziness, drowsiness, menstrual cramps/pain, headache, flushing, or joint/muscle pain.

Sibutramine can substantially increase [[blood pressure]] and heart rate in some patients. Therefore, regular monitoring needs to be performed.

The following side effects are infrequent but serious and require immediate medical attention: [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s, [[paresthesia]], mental/mood changes (e.g., excitement, restlessness, confusion, depression, rare thoughts of [[suicide]]).

Symptoms that require urgent medical attention are [[seizure]]s, problems urinating, abnormal bruising or bleeding, [[melena]], [[hematemesis]], [[jaundice]], [[fever]] and [[rigor (medicine)|rigor]]s, [[chest pain]], [[hemiplegia]], abnormal vision, [[dyspnea]] and [[edema]].

Currently, no case of [[pulmonary hypertension]] has been noted.  (Fenfluramine, of the 1990s &quot;Fen-Phen&quot; combo, forced excess release of neurotransmitters—a different action. Phentermine was uninvolved in the rare—but clinically significant—heart issues of fenfluramine.)

    <title>Rivaroxaban</title>

The most serious adverse effect is [[bleeding]], including severe [[internal bleeding]]. Rivaroxaban is associated with lower rates of serious and fatal bleeding events than warfarin but is associated with higher rates of bleeding in the [[gastrointestinal tract]]. There is currently no antidote for rivaroxaban (unlike warfarin, the action of which can be reversed with [[vitamin K]] or [[prothrombin complex concentrate]]), meaning that serious bleeding may be difficult to manage.

In October 2014, Portola Pharmaceuticals completed Phase I and II clinical trials for [[andexanet alfa]] as an antidote for Factor Xa inhibitors with few adverse effects, and started Phase III trials. Andexanet alfa was expected to be approved in 2016.{{As of| 2017}}, the compound has yet to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

{{As of| 2015}}, post-marketing assessments showed liver toxicity, and further studies are needed to quantify the risk. The drug is contraindicated in people with significant liver disease and end-stage kidney disease, in whom the drug was not trialed.

Rivaroxaban has a [[boxed warning]] to make clear that people using the drug should not discontinue it before talking with their health care professional, because it can increase the risk of stroke.

In 2015, rivaroxaban accounted for the highest number of reported cases of serious injury among regularly monitored drugs to the FDA's Adverse Events Reporting System (AERS).

    <title>Citalopram</title>

[[Sexual dysfunction]] is often a side effect with SSRIs. Specifically, common side effects include difficulty becoming aroused, lack of interest in sex, and [[anorgasmia]] (trouble achieving orgasm). One study showed, however, when remission of major depressive disorder is achieved, quality of life and sexual satisfaction is reported to be higher in spite of sexual side effects.

Citalopram theoretically causes side effects by increasing the concentration of [[serotonin]] in other parts of the body (e.g., the intestines). Other side effects, such as increased apathy and emotional flattening, may be caused by the decrease in [[dopamine]] release associated with increased serotonin. Citalopram is also a mild [[antihistamine]], which may be responsible for some of its sedating properties.{{rp|104}}

Common side effects of citalopram include [[Somnolence|drowsiness]], [[insomnia]], [[nausea]], weight changes (usually weight gain), increase in appetite, vivid dreaming, frequent urination, decreased sex drive, anorgasmia, dry mouth, increased [[perspiration|sweating]], [[Tremor|trembling]], [[diarrhea]], excessive yawning, severe tinnitus, and [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]]. Less common side effects include [[bruxism]], [[vomiting]], [[cardiac arrhythmia]], [[blood pressure]] changes, dilated pupils, [[anxiety]], [[mood swing]]s, [[headache]], and [[dizziness]]. Rare side effects include [[Seizure|convulsions]], [[hallucinations]], severe [[Allergy|allergic reactions]] and [[photosensitivity]]. If sedation occurs, the dose may be taken at bedtime rather than in the morning. Some data suggest citalopram may cause nightmares.

Withdrawal symptoms can occur when this medicine is suddenly stopped, such as [[paraesthesiae]], sleeping problems (difficulty sleeping and intense dreams), feeling dizzy, agitated or anxious, nausea, vomiting, tremors, confusion, sweating, headache, diarrhea, palpitations, changes in emotions, irritability, and eye or eyesight problems. Treatment with citalopram should be reduced gradually when treatment is finished.

Citalopram and other SSRIs can induce a [[Mixed state (psychiatry)|mixed state]], especially in those with undiagnosed [[bipolar disorder]].{{rp|105}}

=== Abnormal heart rhythm ===
In August 2011, the FDA announced, “Citalopram causes dose-dependent [[Drug-induced QT prolongation|QT interval prolongation]]. Citalopram should no longer be prescribed at doses greater than 40 mg per day”. Citalopram is [[Contraindication|contraindicated]] in individuals taking [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAOIs]], owing to a potential for [[serotonin syndrome]].

Taking citalopram with [[Omeprazole]] may cause higher blood levels of citalopram. This is a potentially dangerous interaction, so dosage adjustments may be needed or alternatives may be prescribed.

[[SSRI discontinuation syndrome]] has been reported when treatment is stopped. It includes sensory, gastrointestinal symptoms, dizziness, lethargy, and sleep disturbances, as well as psychological symptoms such as anxiety/agitation, irritability, and poor concentration.  Electric shock-like sensations are typical for SSRI discontinuation. Tapering off citalopram therapy, as opposed to abrupt discontinuation, is recommended in order to diminish the occurrence and severity of discontinuation symptoms. Some doctors choose to switch a patient to [[Fluoxetine|Prozac]] (Fluoxetine) when discontinuing Citalopram as Fluoxetine has a much longer half-life (i.e. stays in the body longer compared to Citalopram). This may avoid many of the severe withdrawal symptoms associated with Citalopram discontinuation. This can be done either by administering a single 20&amp;nbsp;mg dose of Fluoxetine or by beginning on a low dosage of Fluoxetine and slowly tapering down. Either of these prescriptions may be written in liquid form to allow a very slow and gradual tapering down in dosage. Alternatively, a patient wishing to stop taking Citalopram may visit a [[compounding]] pharmacy where his or her prescription may be re-arranged into progressively smaller dosages.

===Overdosage===
Overdosage may result in vomiting, sedation, disturbances in heart rhythm, dizziness, sweating, nausea, tremor, and rarely amnesia, confusion, coma, or convulsions.{{rp|105}} Overdose deaths have occurred, sometimes involving other drugs, but also with citalopram as the sole agent. Citalopram and N-desmethylcitalopram may be quantified in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma citalopram concentrations are usually in a range of 50-400 μg/l in persons receiving the drug therapeutically, 1000-3000 μg/l in patients who survive acute overdosage and 3–30&amp;nbsp;mg/l in those who do not survive.

The side effects for Levonantradol include ptosis, sedation, and ataxia in non-human primates. In rodents, the symptoms include dysphoria, memory impairment, motor incoordination, reduced concentration, and disorientation. Levonantradol also decreases startle response. In humans, side effects include dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness, altered perception, mild sedation, and lack of concentration. It can cause an increase in heart rate and decrease in blood pressure. Euphoric symptoms rarely occurred in subjects.

    <title>Amikacin</title>

Side-effects of amikacin are similar to those of other aminoglycosides. [[Nephrotoxicity|Kidney damage]] and [[ototoxicity]] (which can lead to hearing loss) are the most important effects, occurring in 1–10% of users. The nephro- and ototoxicity are thought to be due to aminoglycosides' tendency to accumulate in the kidneys and inner ear.
[[File:Gray920.png|thumb|Diagram of the inner ear. Amikacin causes damage to the cochlea and vestibules.|300x300px]]
Amikacin can cause neurotoxicity if used at a higher dose or for longer than recommended. The resulting effects of neurotoxicity include [[vertigo]], [[numbness]], [[Paresthesia|tingling]] of the skin ([[paresthesia]]), muscle [[Convulsion|twitching]], and [[seizures]]. Its toxic effect on the 8th [[cranial nerve]] causes ototoxicity, resulting in loss of balance and, more commonly, hearing loss. Damage to the [[cochlea]], caused by the forced [[apoptosis]] of the [[hair cell]]s, leads to the loss of high-frequency hearing and happens before any clinical hearing loss can be detected. it then most likely interferes with the metabolism of [[phospholipids]] in the [[lysosomes]], which causes lytic enzymes to leak into the cytoplasm. Nephrotoxicity results in increased serum [[creatinine]], [[blood urea nitrogen]], [[red blood cells]], and [[white blood cells]], as well as [[albuminuria]] (increased output of [[albumin]] in the urine), [[glycosuria]] (excretion of glucose into the urine), decreased urine [[specific gravity]], and [[oliguria]] (decrease in overall urine output). It can also cause [[urinary casts]] to appear. The changes in [[renal tubular]] function also change the electrolyte levels and acid-base balance in the body, which can lead to [[hypokalemia]] and [[acidosis]] or [[alkalosis]]. Nephrotoxicity is more common in those with pre-existing hypokalema, [[hypocalcemia]], [[hypomagnesemia]], acidosis, low [[Renal function#Glomerular filtration rate|glomerular filtration rate]], [[diabetes mellitus]], dehydration, fever, and [[sepsis]], as well as those taking [[Prostaglandins|antiprostaglandins]]. The toxicity usually reverts once the antibiotic course has been completed, and can be avoided altogether by less frequent dosing (such as once every 24 hours rather than once every 8 hours).

Amikacin can cause neuromuscular blockade (including acute muscular paralysis) and respiratory paralysis (including [[apnea]]).

Rare side effects (occurring in fewer than 1% of users) include allergic reactions, [[skin rash]], [[drug fever|fever]], [[headache]]s, [[tremor]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], [[eosinophilia]], [[arthralgia]], [[anemia]], [[hypotension]], and hypomagnesemia. In intravitreous injections (where amikacin is injected into the eye), macular [[infarction]] can cause permanent vision loss.

Additionally, very common adverse effects, occurring in more than 10% of people, include peripheral edema, headaches, trouble breathing, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, nausea, rashes, and fever.

Common adverse effects, occurring in between 1 and 10% of people, include sinus infections, low numbers of white and red blood cells ([[agranulocytosis]], [[pancytopenia]], [[thrombocytopenia]], [[leukopenia]], and [[anemia]]), low blood sugar, reduced amount of potassium and sodium, depression, hallucinations, anxiety, insomnia, agitation, confusion, convulsions, fainting, tremor, weakness, tingling, sleepiness, dizziness, bleeding retina, irregular heart beats, slow or fast heart beats, low blood pressure, inflamed veins, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary edema, inflamed lips, swollen face, stomach upset, constipation, gingivitis, jaundice, hair loss, flaky skin, itchiness, red skin, back pain, chest pain, and chills.

[[Torsades de pointes]] is the most serious side effect of dofetilide therapy.  The incidence of torsades de pointes is 0.3-10.5% and is dose-related, with increased incidence associated with higher doses.

The risk of inducing torsades de pointes can be decreased by taking precautions when initiating therapy, such as hospitalizing individuals for a minimum of three days for serial [[creatinine]] measurement, continuous [[telemetry]] monitoring and availability of cardiac resuscitation.

    <title>Ximelagatran</title>

Ximelagatran was generally well tolerated in the trial populations, but a small proportion (5-6%) developed elevated [[liver enzyme]] levels, which prompted the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] to reject an initial application for approval in 2004. The further development was discontinued in 2006 following reports of hepatotoxicity. Subsequent analysis of Phase 2 clinical study data using extreme value modelling (see [[Extreme value theory]]) showed that the elevated [[liver enzyme]] levels observed in Phase 3 clinical studies could have been predicted; if this had been known at the time, it might have affected decisions on future development of the compound.

    <title>Oprelvekin</title>

Neumega has caused allergic reaction which at times have been very serious. Symptoms have been [[edema]] of the face and tongue, or [[larynx]]; shortness of breath; [[wheezing]]; chest pain; [[hypotension]] (including [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]]); dysarthria; loss of consciousness, [[rash]], [[urticaria]], [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]], and [[fever]]. These reaction can occur after the first dose or after any later application. Neumega should be permanently discontinued in patients with any sign of allergy. Treatment is largely symptomatic.

Oprelvekin also has caused quite often fluid retention, ranging from peripheral [[edema]] (approximately 40% of patients) to [[dyspnea]] and full developed [[lung edema]] with or without cardiac decompensation (see contraindications and precautions). These symptoms have led to some deaths. Fluid retention my also lead to dilutional anemia (in 10 to 15% of patients). Hypokalemia my also result. Symptoms of fluid retention have been observed more often in patients following [[myeloablative chemotherapy]] (see contraindications). Severe arrhythmias ([[atrial flutter]] and [[atrial fibrillation]]) as well as fatal [[cardiac arrest]] have also been seen which may or may be not attributed to fluid retention/increased volume. Isolated cases of [[stroke]] have been noted, those patients with previous transient ischemic attacks or partial/minor strokes may be at particular risk.

[[Papilledema]] of the eyes has been observed (2%) and may lead to disturbed [[visual acuity]] and even temporary or permanent [[blindness]]. Patients with preexisting papilledema or with involvement of the central nervous system may be at higher risk.

In postmarketing studies isolated cases of severe [[ventricular arrhythmias]] and [[renal failure]] have been seen.

Injection site reaction like have also been observed (dermatitis, pain, and discoloration), but are usually mild.

    <title>Riboflavin</title>

In humans, there is no evidence for riboflavin toxicity produced by excessive intakes, in part because it has lower water solubility than other B vitamins, because absorption becomes less efficient as doses increase, and because what excess is absorbed is excreted via the kidneys into urine. any excess at nutritionally relevant doses is excreted in the urine, imparting a bright yellow color when in large quantities.

    <title>Mercaptopurine</title>


Some of the [[adverse drug reaction|adverse reaction]]s of taking mercaptopurine may include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, fatigue, stomach/abdominal pain, weakness, skin [[rash]], darkening of the skin, and hair loss. Serious adverse reactions include mouth sores, [[fever]], [[sore throat]], easy bruising or bleeding, pinpoint red spots on the skin, yellowing of eyes or skin, dark [[urine]], and painful or difficult urination. Other more serious side effects include black or tarry [[human feces|stools]] ([[melena]]), bloody stools, and bloody [[urine]].

Symptoms of allergic reaction to mercaptopurine include [[rash]], [[itching]], [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]], [[dizziness]], trouble [[breathing]], and [[pancreatitis|inflammation of the pancreas]].

In some cases, mercaptopurine may [[myelosuppression|suppress the production of blood cells]], both [[white blood cell]]s and [[red blood cell]]s. It may be toxic to [[bone marrow]]. Quarterly blood counts are necessary for people on mercaptopurine.  People should stop taking the medication at least temporarily while considering alternate treatment if there is an unexplained, abnormally large drop in white blood cell count, or any other blood count.

Toxicity of mercaptopurine can be linked to genetic polymorphisms in [[Thiopurine methyltransferase|thiopurine ''S''-methyltransferase (TPMT)]], [[NUDT15|nudix hydrolase 15(NUDT15)]], and inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPA). People with specific allele variants will require dose adjustments, especially for those with homozygous variant genotypes. Large differences of TPMT and NUDT15 among ethnicities in terms of variant allele frequency should be take into consideration in clinical practice. Caucasian people with a variant allele of the ITPA gene, experience higher rates of febrile neuropenia than people of other ethnic groups, due to differences in allelic frequencies among ethnicities.

===Precautions===

Mercaptopurine can lower the body's ability to fight off infection. Those taking it should get permission from a doctor to receive [[immunization]]s and [[vaccination]]s. It is also recommended that, while on the drug, one should avoid those having recently received oral [[polio]] vaccine.

This drug was formerly not recommended during pregnancy and early evidence indicated pregnant women on the drug (or the related [[azathioprine]]) showed a seven-fold incidence of fetal abnormalities as well as a 20-fold increase in miscarriage. There were also anecdotal reports linking mercaptopurine with spontaneous abortion, leading to the US FDA rating both AZA and mercaptopurine as category D drugs. However, Davis et al. 1999 found mercaptopurine, compared to [[methotrexate]], was ineffective as a single-agent [[abortifacient]]; every woman in the mercaptopurine arm of the study had fetal cardiac activity at follow-up (two weeks later) and was given a [[suction abortion]]. A more recent, larger study, however, performed by the Cancers et Surrisque Associe aux Maladies inflamatoires intestinales En France (CESAME) indicated an overall rate of congenital malformations not significantly greater than the general population in France. The European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) concluded in a consensus paper in 2010 that while AZA and mercaptopurine have an FDA rating of D, new research in both animals and humans indicates that &quot;thiopurines are safe and well tolerated during pregnancy.&quot;

Mercaptopurine causes changes to [[chromosome]]s in animals and humans, though a study in 1990 found, &quot;while the carcinogenic potential of 6-MP cannot be precluded, it can be only very weak or marginal.&quot;  Another study in 1999 noted an increased risk of developing leukemia when taking large doses of 6-MP with other [[cytotoxic]] drugs.

    <title>Nitrofurantoin</title>

The most common side effects with nitrofurantoin are nausea, headache, and flatulence. Less common adverse events (occurring in less than 1% of those taking the drug) include:
*Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, [[dyspepsia]], abdominal pain, constipation, emesis 
*Neurologic: dizziness, drowsiness, [[amblyopia]] 
*Respiratory: acute pulmonary hypersensitivity reaction 
*Allergic: [[pruritus]], [[urticaria]]
*Dermatologic: [[hair loss]] 
*Miscellaneous: fever, chills, malaise

Patients should be informed that nitrofurantoin colours urine brown; this is completely harmless.

Some of the more serious but rare side effects of nitrofurantoin have been a cause of concern. These include pulmonary reactions, hepatotoxicity, and neuropathy.

===Pulmonary toxicity===
The pulmonary toxicity caused by nitrofurantoin can be categorized into acute, subacute, and chronic pulmonary reactions. The acute and subacute reactions are thought to be due to a hypersensitivity reaction and often resolve when the drug is discontinued. Acute reactions have been estimated to occur in about one in 5000 women who take the drug. These reactions usually develop 3–8 days after the first dose of nitrofurantoin, but may occur from a few hours to a few weeks after starting the drug. Symptoms include fever, [[dyspnea]], chills, cough, [[pleuritic]] chest pain, headache, back pain, and [[epigastric]] pain.  Chest radiograph will often show unilateral or bilateral infiltrates similar to [[pulmonary edema]]. Treatment includes discontinuation of the nitrofurantoin, which should result in symptom improvement within 24 hours.

Chronic pulmonary reactions caused by nitrofurantoin include diffuse [[interstitial pneumonitis]], [[pulmonary fibrosis]], or both. This uncommon reaction may occur 1 month to 6 years after starting the drug and is usually related to its total lifetime dose. This reaction manifests with progressive shortness of breath. It is important to recognize nitrofurantoin as possible cause of symptoms and discontinue the drug when the suspicion of pulmonary side effects arises as it can be reversible if the drug is stopped early.

===Hepatotoxicity===
Hepatic reactions, including [[hepatitis]], cholestatic [[jaundice]], chronic active hepatitis, and hepatic [[necrosis]], occur rarely. The onset of chronic active hepatitis may be insidious, and patients should be monitored periodically for changes in biochemical tests that would indicate liver injury. These reactions usually occur after exposure to the drug for more than 6 weeks. If signs of liver failure are observed in a patient taking nitrofurantoin, the drug should be discontinued. Re-challenge with the drug at a later date is not recommended, as the reaction may have a hypersensitivity component and recur when the drug is resumed.

===Neuropathy===
[[Neuropathy]] is a rare side effect of taking nitrofurantoin. Patients may experience numbness and tingling in a stocking-glove pattern, which may or may not improve upon discontinuation of the drug.

===Contraindications===
Nitrofurantoin is contraindicated in patients with decreased renal function (CrCl &lt; 60 ml/min) due to systemic accumulation and subtherapeutic levels reached in the urinary tract. However, a retrospective chart review suggests the data for this cutoff are slim and a cutoff of CrCl &lt; 40 ml/min would be more appropriate. Many of the severe side effects of this drug are more common in the elderly and those with renal impairment, as this causes the drug to be retained in the body and reach higher systemic levels. Thus, the drug is not recommended for the elderly population according to 2012 AGS Beers criteria.

Nitrofurantoin is also contraindicated in babies up to the age of one month, as they have immature enzyme systems in their [[erythrocyte|red blood cell]]s ([[glutathione]] instability), so nitrofurantoin must not be used because it can cause [[haemolytic anaemia]]. For the same reason, nitrofurantoin should not be given to pregnant women after 38 weeks of pregnancy. Nitrofurantoin is contraindicated in patients with [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]] because of risk of [[intravascular]] [[hemolysis]] resulting in [[anemia]].

    <title>Atorvastatin</title>


===Major===
* [[Diabetes mellitus type 2]], an uncommon class effect of all statins. and [[rhabdomyolysis]] are the most serious side effects, occurring rarely at a rate of 2.3 to 9.1 per 10,000 person-years among patients taking atorvastatin. As mentioned previously, atorvastatin should be discontinued immediately if this occurs.
* Persistent liver enzyme abnormalities occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin in clinical trials. It is recommended that hepatic function be assessed with laboratory tests before beginning atorvastatin treatment and repeated as clinically indicated thereafter. If evidence of serious liver injury occurs while a patient is taking atorvastatin, it should be discontinued and not restarted until the etiology of the patient's liver dysfunction is defined. If no other cause is found, atorvastatin should be discontinued permanently.

===Common===
The following have been shown to occur in 1–10% of patients taking atorvastatin in clinical trials.
* [[Arthralgia]]
* [[Diarrhea]]
* [[Dyspepsia]]
* [[Myalgia]]
* [[Nausea]]

High-dose atorvastatin have also been associated with worsening glycemic control.

=== Interactions ===
Interactions with clofibrate, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, which are fibrates used in accessory therapy in many forms of [[hypercholesterolemia]], usually in combination with statins, increase the risk of [[myopathy]] and [[rhabdomyolysis]].

Co-administration of atorvastatin with one of [[CYP3A4]] inhibitors such as [[itraconazole]], [[telithromycin]], and [[voriconazole]], may increase serum concentrations of atorvastatin, which may lead to adverse reactions. This is less likely to happen with other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as [[diltiazem]], [[erythromycin]], [[fluconazole]], [[ketoconazole]], [[clarithromycin]], [[cyclosporine]], [[Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease inhibitors]], or [[verapamil]], and only rarely with other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as [[amiodarone]] and [[aprepitant]]. Often, [[bosentan]], [[fosphenytoin]], and [[phenytoin]], which are CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Only rarely, though, [[barbiturate]]s, [[carbamazepine]], [[efavirenz]], [[nevirapine]], [[oxcarbazepine]], [[rifampicin|rifampin]], and [[rifamycin]], which are also CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. [[Oral contraceptive]]s increased AUC values for [[norethisterone]] and [[ethinylestradiol]]; these increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin.

[[Antacid]]s can rarely decrease the plasma concentrations of statin medications, but do not affect the [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL-C]]-lowering [[efficacy]].

Statins may also alter the concentrations of other medications, such as [[warfarin]] or [[digoxin]], leading to alterations in effect or a requirement for clinical monitoring.

[[Vitamin D]] supplementation lowers atorvastatin and active metabolite concentrations, yet [[synergy|synergistically]] reduces LDL and total [[cholesterol]] concentrations. [[Grapefruit juice]] components are known inhibitors of intestinal CYP3A4.

Co-administration of grapefruit juice with atorvastatin may cause an increase in [[Cmax (pharmacology)|C&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;]] and AUC, which can lead to adverse reactions or overdose toxicity.

A few cases of myopathy have been reported when atorvastatin is given with [[colchicine]].

Although relatively few side effects are associated with dextran use, these side effects can be very serious. These include [[anaphylaxis]], volume overload, [[pulmonary edema]], [[cerebral edema]], or platelet dysfunction.

An uncommon but significant complication of dextran osmotic effect is [[acute renal failure]]. The pathogenesis of this renal failure is the subject of many debates with direct toxic effect on tubules and [[glomerulus]] versus intraluminal hyperviscosity being some of the proposed mechanisms.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Patients with history of [[diabetes mellitus]], [[Renal failure|renal insufficiency]], or vascular disorders are most at risk.

    <title>Flecainide</title>

Results of a medical study known as the [[Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial|Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST)]] demonstrated that patients with structural heart disease (such as a history of MI (heart attack), or left ventricular dysfunction) and also patients with ventricular arrhythmias, should not take this drug. The results were so significant that the trial was stopped early and preliminary results were published.

As with all class I [[antiarrhythmic agents]], Flecainide increases the capture thresholds of [[artificial pacemaker|pacemakers]]. and administration of a sodium load(often in the form of [[Tonicity#Hypertonicity|hypertonic]] [[sodium bicarbonate]]).  Placing the individual on cardiopulmonary bypass support may be necessary in order to temporarily remove the need for a beating heart and to increase blood flow to the liver.

    <title>Metamizole</title>

Metamizole has a potential of haematologic (blood-related) toxicity (blood [[dyscrasia]]s), but causes less [[renal|kidney]], [[cardiovascular]], and GI toxicity than [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs). Like NSAIDs, it can trigger bronchospasm or [[anaphylaxis]], especially in those with [[asthma]]. The relative risk for agranulocytosis appears to greatly vary according to the country of estimates on said rate and opinion on the risk is strongly divided.

Oral [[anticoagulants]] (blood thinners), [[lithium (medication)|lithium]], [[captopril]], [[triamterene]] and [[antihypertensive]]s may also interact with metamizole, as other [[pyrazolone]]s are known to interact adversely with these substances.

===Overdose===
It is considered fairly safe on overdose, but in these cases supportive measures are usually advised as well as measures to limit absorption (such as [[activated charcoal]]) and accelerate excretion (such as [[haemodialysis]]).

It may produce less [[QT interval]] prolongation than [[zotepine]], as in one patient who had previously been on zotepine switching to perospirone corrected their prolonged QT interval. It also tended to produce less severe [[extrapyramidal side effects]] than haloperidol in a clinical trial comparing the two (although statistical significance was not reached).

    <title>Danazol</title>

{{See also|Anabolic steroid#Adverse effects}}

Androgenic side effects are of concern, as some women taking danazol may experience unwanted hair growth ([[hirsutism]]), [[acne vulgaris|acne]], irreversible [[voice change|deepening of the voice]], or adverse [[lipid profile|blood lipid profile]]s. In addition, [[breast atrophy]] and decreased breast size may occur. The drug may also cause [[hot flash]]es, [[elevated transaminases|elevation of liver enzyme]]s, and [[mood disorder|mood changes]]. Some patients who use danazol experience [[weight gain]] and [[Water retention (medicine)|fluid retention]]. Due to its side effects, danazol is seldom prescribed continuously beyond six months.

The use of danazol for endometriosis has been linked to an increased risk of [[ovarian cancer]]. Patients with endometriosis have specific risk factors for ovarian cancer, so this may not apply for other uses.

Danazol, like most other androgenic drugs, has been linked with an increased risk of [[liver tumors]]. These are generally [[benign tumor|benign]].

    <title>Amoxicillin</title>

[[Adverse drug reaction|Side effect]]s are similar to those for other [[β-lactam antibiotic]]s,  including [[nausea]], vomiting, rashes, and antibiotic-associated [[colitis]]. Loose bowel movements (diarrhea) may also occur. Rarer side effects include mental changes, lightheadedness, insomnia, confusion, anxiety, sensitivity to lights and sounds, and unclear thinking. Immediate medical care is required upon the first signs of these side effects.

The onset of an allergic reaction to amoxicillin can be very sudden and intense; emergency medical attention must be sought as quickly as possible. The initial phase of such a reaction often starts with a change in mental state, skin rash with intense itching (often beginning in fingertips and around groin area and rapidly spreading), and sensations of fever, nausea, and vomiting. Any other symptoms that seem even remotely suspicious must be taken very seriously.  However, more mild allergy symptoms, such as a rash, can occur at any time during treatment, even up to a week after treatment has ceased.  For some people allergic to amoxicillin, the side effects can be fatal due to [[anaphylaxis]].

Use of the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid combination for more than one week has caused mild [[hepatitis]] in some patients. Young children having ingested acute overdoses of amoxicillin manifested [[lethargy]], vomiting, and [[Renal failure|renal dysfunction]].

===Nonallergic rash===
Between 3 and 10% of children taking amoxicillin (or [[ampicillin]]) show a late-developing (&gt;72 hours after beginning medication and having never taken penicillin-like medication previously) rash, which is sometimes referred to as the &quot;amoxicillin rash&quot;. The rash can also occur in adults.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The rash is described as [[maculopapular]] or morbilliform ([[Measles|measles-like]]; therefore, in medical literature, it is called &quot;amoxicillin-induced morbilliform rash&quot;.). It starts on the trunk and can spread from there. This rash is unlikely to be a true allergic reaction and is not a contraindication for future amoxicillin usage, nor should the current regimen necessarily be stopped. However, this common amoxicillin rash and a dangerous allergic reaction cannot easily be distinguished by inexperienced persons, so a healthcare professional is often required to distinguish between the two.

A nonallergic amoxicillin rash may also be an indicator of [[infectious mononucleosis]]. Some studies indicate about 80-90% of patients with acute [[Epstein Barr virus]] infection treated with amoxicillin or ampicillin develop such a rash.

    <title>Trimethoprim</title>


=== Common  ===
* Nausea
* Change in taste
* Vomiting 
* Diarrhea 
* Rash 
* Sun sensitivity 
* Itchiness

=== Rare ===
* Can cause [[thrombocytopenia]] (low levels of [[platelets]]) by lowering [[folic acid]] levels; this may also cause [[megaloblastic anemia]].
* Trimethoprim antagonizes the [[epithelial sodium channel]] &lt;!-- (ENaC) --&gt; in the [[distal tubule]], thus acting like [[amiloride]].  This can cause increased potassium levels in the body ([[hyperkalemia]]). 
* Can compete with [[creatinine]] for secretion into the renal tubule.  This can cause an artificial rise in the serum creatinine. 
* Use in [[EHEC]] infections may lead to an increase in expression of [[Shiga toxin]].

=== Contraindications ===
* Known [[hypersensitivity]] to trimethoprim
* History of [[megaloblastic anemia]] due to folate deficiency&lt;!-- supports all --&gt;

=== Liver and kidney problems ===
10-20% of trimethoprim is metabolized by the liver and the rest is excreted in the urine. Therefore, trimethoprim should be used with caution in individuals with kidney and liver impairments. Dosage adjustment is not needed for liver impairment but should be adjusted for kidney impairment.

=== Pregnancy ===
Based on studies that show that trimethoprim crosses the [[placenta]] and can affect folate metabolism, there has been growing evidence of the risk of structural birth defects associated with trimethoprim, especially during the first [[Pregnancy|trimester]] of pregnancy. It may be involved in a reaction similar to [[disulfiram]] when alcohol is consumed after it is used, in particular when used in combination with [[sulfamethoxazole]].
The trophoblasts in the early fetus are sensitive to changes in the folate cycle. A recent study has found a doubling in the risk of miscarriage in women exposed to trimethoprim in the early pregnancy.

    <title>Benazepril</title>

The most common side effects patients experience are a [[headache]] or a chronic [[cough]].  The chronic cough  develops in about 20% of patients treated, and those patients that experience it find it develops after a few months of use.  [[Anaphylaxis]], [[angioedema]], and  [[hyperkalemia|elevation of potassium levels]] are more serious side effects that can also occur.

    <title>Ticagrelor</title>

The most common side effects are [[shortness of breath]] (dyspnea, 14%) and various types of bleeding, such as [[hematoma]], [[nosebleed]], [[gastrointestinal]], [[Subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous]] or [[dermal]] bleeding. Ventricular pauses of 3 seconds occur in 5 percent of people in the first week of treatment. Ticagrelor should be administered with caution or avoided in patients with advanced sinoauricular disease. Allergic skin reactions such as [[rash]] and [[itching]] have been observed in less than 1% of patients.

===Common side effects===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}

• Drowsiness
• Dry mouth
• Headache

===Serotonin turnover===
Studies have shown that benzoctamine decreases the rate of turnover of serotonin. Scientists confirmed these results and proposed that the method of action was inhibition of serotonin uptake since the drug also blocked the serotonin depleting action of extra-neuronal monoamine transporters (EMT). This means that body temperature effects cannot be ruled out.

    <title>Mirtazapine</title>

A 2011 Cochrane review found that compared with other antidepressants, it is more likely to cause weight gain and sleepiness, but it is less likely to cause tremor than tricyclic antidepressants, and less likely to cause nausea and sexual dysfunction than SSRIs.

Very common (≥10% incidence) adverse effects include constipation, dry mouth, sleepiness, increased appetite and weight gain.

Mirtazapine is not considered to have a risk of many of the side effects often associated with other antidepressants like the SSRIs, and may actually improve certain ones when taken in conjunction with them. (Those adverse effects include [[anorexia (symptom)|decreased appetite]], [[weight loss]], [[insomnia]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], [[diarrhoea]], [[urinary retention]], increased [[body temperature]], [[diaphoresis|excessive sweating]], [[mydriasis|pupil dilation]] and [[sexual dysfunction]].)

In general, some antidepressants, especially SSRIs, can paradoxically exacerbate some peoples' depression or anxiety or cause [[suicidal ideation]].

    <title>Betahistine</title>

Patients taking betahistine may experience following side effects:

* Headache
* Low level of gastric side effects
* Nausea can be a side effect, but the patient is generally already experiencing nausea due to the vertigo so it goes largely unnoticed.
* Patients taking betahistine may experience several hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. In the November 2006 issue of &quot;Drug Safety,&quot; Dr. Sabine Jeck-Thole and Dr. Wolfgang Wagner reported that betahistine may cause several allergic and skin-related side effects. These include rash in several areas of the body; itching and hives; and swelling of the face, tongue and mouth. Other hypersensitivity reactions reported include tingling, numbness, burning sensations, shortness of breath and laboured breathing. The study authors suggest that hypersensitivity reactions may be a direct result of betahistine's role in increasing histamine levels throughout the body. Hypersensitivity reactions quickly subside after betahistine has been discontinued.

===Digestive===
Betahistine may also cause several digestive-related side effects. The package insert for Serc, a trade name for betahistine, states that patients may experience several gastrointestinal side effects. These may include nausea, upset stomach, vomiting, diarrhea and stomach cramping. These symptoms are usually not serious and subside between doses. Patients experiencing chronic digestive problems may lower their dose to the minimum effective range and by taking betahistine with meals. Additional digestive problems may require that patients consult their physician in order to find a possible suitable alternative.

===Others===
People taking betahistine may experience several other side effects ranging from mild to serious. The package insert for Serc states that patients may experience nervous-system side effects, including headache. Some nervous system events may also partly be attributable to the underlying condition rather than the medication used to treat it. The study by Jeck-Thole and Wagner also reports that patients may experience headache and liver problems, including increased liver enzymes and bile-flow disturbances. Any side effects that persist or outweigh the relief of symptoms of the original condition may warrant that the patient consult their physician to adjust or change the medication.

    <title>Zoledronic acid</title>

Side effects can include [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], [[anemia]], [[muscle pain|muscle aches]], [[fever]], and/or [[Edema|swelling]] in the feet or legs. [[Flu-like symptoms]] are commonly experienced after the first zoledronate infusion, although not subsequent infusions, and are thought to occur because of its potential to activate human [[γδ T cells]] (gamma/delta T cells).

===Kidneys===
There is a risk of severe renal impairment. Appropriate [[Rehydration|hydration]] is important prior to administration, as is adequate [[calcium]] and [[vitamin D]] intake prior to Aclasta therapy in patients with preexisting [[hypocalcaemia]], and for ten days following Aclasta in patients with Paget's disease of the bone. Monitoring for other mineral metabolism disorders and the avoidance of invasive dental procedures for those who develop [[osteonecrosis of the jaw]] is recommended.

Zoledronate is rapidly processed via the [[kidney]]s; consequently its administration is not recommended for patients with reduced [[renal function]] or kidney disease. Some cases of acute renal failure either requiring dialysis or having a fatal outcome following Reclast use have been reported to the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). This assessment was confirmed by the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA), whose Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) specified new contraindications for the medication on 15 December 2011, which include hypocalcaemia and severe renal impairment with a [[creatinine]] clearance of less than 35 ml/min.

===Bone===
A rare complication that has been recently observed in cancer patients being treated with bisphosphonates is [[osteonecrosis of the jaw]].  This has mainly been seen in patients with [[multiple myeloma]] treated with zoledronate who have had [[dental extraction]]s.

Atypical fractures : After approving the drug on 8 July 2009, the [[European Medicines Agency]] conducted a class review of all [[bisphosphonates]], including Zoledronate, after several cases of atypical fractures were reported.

    <title>Doxycycline</title>

Cautions and side effects are similar to those of other members of the [[Tetracycline antibiotics|tetracycline]] antibiotic group.

An [[erythematous]] rash in sun-exposed parts of the body has been reported to occur in 7.3–21.2% of persons taking doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis. One study examined the tolerability of various malaria prophylactic regimens and found doxycycline did not cause a significantly higher percentage of all skin events (photosensitivity not specified) when compared with other antimalarials. The rash resolves upon discontinuation of the drug.

Unlike some other members of the tetracycline group, it may be used in those with renal impairment.

===Interactions===
The combination of doxycycline with dairy, antacids, calcium supplements, iron products, and laxatives containing magnesium is not inherently dangerous, but any of these foods and supplements may decrease doxycycline's effectiveness.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Breakfast was observed to reduce doxycycline absorption significantly. Absorption of tetracycline occurs in the stomach and the upper small intestine. Absorption of tetracyclines has been reported to be impaired by milk products, aluminum hydroxide gels, sodium bicarbonate, calcium and magnesium salts, laxatives containing magnesium and iron preparations. The mechanisms responsible for decreased absorption appear to be chelation and an increase in gastric pH. ... In view of these results, it is advisable to instruct the patients to take doxycycline on an empty stomach.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Previously, doxycycline was believed to impair the effectiveness of many types of [[hormonal contraception]] due to [[Cytochrome P450|CYP450]] induction. Recent research has shown no significant loss of effectiveness in oral contraceptives while using most tetracycline antibiotics (including doxycycline), although many physicians still recommend the use of barrier contraception for people taking the drug to prevent unwanted pregnancy.

Doxycycline crosses into breastmilk. The adverse effects on teeth and long bones of children directly administered tetracycline antibiotics is documented, but these effects have not been recorded in infants exposed through breastmilk. Although the dose an infant would receive through breastfeeding would likely be minimal, a theoretical risk exists.

    <title>Trimipramine</title>

The side effects of trimipramine have been said to be similar to those of other tertiary amine TCAs, with a preponderance of [[anticholinergic]] and [[sedative]] effects. However, trimipramine has also been said to be associated with a different side effect profile compared to other TCAs and in general with fewer side effects, chiefly due to its lack of [[norepinephrine reuptake inhibition]] and relatively lower anticholinergic effects (although it is still a potent anticholinergic). [[Somnolence]] is the most common side effect of the drug. [[Dry mouth]] is the most common anticholinergic side effect, but others like [[constipation]], [[urinary retention]], and [[blurred vision]] are also present.

It is described as being associated with minimal or no [[orthostatic hypotension]], at least in comparison to [[clomipramine]], in spite of its potent and comparable activity as an [[alpha-1 blocker]]. However, it has also been said to have a rate of orthostatic hypotension similar to that of other TCAs. Trimipramine is said to be less [[epileptogenic]] than other TCAs, although [[seizure]]s have still been reported in association with it. It is also less [[cardiotoxic]] than other TCAs and cardiotoxicity is said to be minimal, with a &quot;very favorable profile&quot;.

===List of side effects===
Common adverse effects include:

The mechanism of action of its anxiolytic effects is similarly unclear. Indeed, its prominent anxiolytic effects have been said to distinguish it from most other TCAs. That said, blockade of the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;, 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2C&lt;/sub&gt;, and α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-adrenergic receptors, as with [[mirtazapine]], It can be safely combined with MAOIs apparently without risk of [[serotonin syndrome]] or [[hypertensive crisis]].

    <title>Domperidone</title>

Side effects associated with domperidone include [[dry mouth]], [[abdominal cramp]]s, [[diarrhea]], [[nausea]], [[rash]], [[pruritus|itching]], [[urticaria|hives]], and [[hyperprolactinemia]] (the symptoms of which may include [[mammoplasia|breast enlargement]], [[galactorrhea]], [[mastodynia|breast pain/tenderness]], [[gynecomastia]], [[hypogonadism]], and [[irregular menstruation|menstrual irregularities]]). However, this is not the case with domperidone, because, unlike other D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonists, it minimally crosses the [[blood-brain-barrier]], and for this reason, is rarely associated with such side effects.

===Excess prolactin levels===
Due to D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor blockade, domperidone causes [[hyperprolactinemia]]. Also in accordance with hyperprolactinemia, 10–15% of female patients have been reported to experience [[mammoplasia]] (breast enlargement), [[mastodynia]] (breast pain/tenderness), [[galactorrhea]] (inappropriate or excessive milk production/secretion), and [[amenorrhea]] (cessation of [[menstrual cycle]]s) with domperidone treatment. [[Gynecomastia]] has been reported in males treated with domperidone,

===Rare reactions===

====Cardiac reactions====
Domperidone use is associated with an increased risk of [[sudden cardiac death]] (by 70%)

{{Quotation|''Based on the results of the two TQT (the regulatory agency gold standard for assessment of QT prolongation) domperidone does not appear to be strongly associated with QT prolongation at oral doses of 20 mg QID in healthy volunteers. Further, there are limited case reports supporting an association with cardiac dysfunction, and the frequently cited case-control studies have significant flaws. While there remains an ill-defined risk at higher systemic concentrations, especially in patients with a higher baseline risk of QT prolongation, our review does not support the view that domperidone presents intolerable risk.''}}

====Possible central toxicity in infants====
In [[United Kingdom|Britain]] a legal case involved the death of two children of a mother whose three children had all had [[hypernatraemia]]. She was charged with poisoning the children with salt. One of the children, who was born at 28 weeks gestation with [[respiratory]] complications and had a [[fundoplication]] for [[gastroesophageal reflux]] and [[failure to thrive]] was prescribed domperidone. An [[advocate]] for the mother suggested the child may have suffered [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]] as a side effect of domperidone due to the drug crossing the child's immature [[blood-brain-barrier]].

    <title>Exemestane</title>

The most common side effects (more than 10% of patients) are [[hot flash]]es and sweating, which are typical of estrogen deficiency as caused by exemestane, and also [[insomnia]], headache, and [[joint pain]]. Nausea and [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] are mainly observed in patients with advanced breast cancer.

An occasional decrease in lymphocytes has been observed in approximately 20% of patients receiving Aromasin, particularly in patients with pre-existing lymphopenia. 

Exemestane has [[androgen]]ic properties similarly to [[formestane]] and can produce androgenic side effects such as [[acne]] and [[weight gain]], although these are generally associated with supratherapeutic dosages of the drug.

As with niacin and related drugs, the most common adverse effects are [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]] (associated with [[prostaglandin D2|prostaglandin D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) and gastrointestinal disturbances such as [[indigestion]], which occur in at least 10% of patients. Flushing can be reduced by taking [[aspirin]] 20 to 30 minutes before taking acipimox. [[Palpitations]] have also been described.{{fact|date=July 2016}} High doses can cause headache, and precipitate [[gout]].{{fact|date=July 2016}}  In contrast to niacin, no impairment of [[glucose tolerance]] and no disorders of liver function have been found in studies, even under high doses of acipimox.

    <title>Praziquantel</title>

The majority of side effects develop due to the release of the contents of the parasites as they are killed and the consequent host immune reaction. The heavier the parasite burden, the heavier and more frequent the side effects normally are.
* Central nervous system: Frequently occurring side effects are [[dizziness]], [[headache]], and malaise. [[Drowsiness]], [[somnolence]], [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], and [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]] have also been seen. Almost all patients with cerebral [[cysticercosis]] experience CNS side effects related to the cell-death of the parasites (headache, worsening of pre-existing neurological problems, [[seizures]], [[arachnoiditis]], and [[meningism]]). These side effects may be life-threatening and can be reduced by coadministration of [[corticosteroid]]s. It is strongly recommended that all patients with cerebral [[cysticercosis]] are hospitalized during treatment.
* Gastrointestinal tract: Approximately 90% of all patients have abdominal pain or cramps with or without nausea and vomiting. [[Diarrhea]] may develop and may be severe with colic. Sweating, fever, and sometimes bloody stools may occur together with diarrhea.
* Liver: Asymptomatic and transient increases of liver enzymes ([[Aspartate transaminase|AST]] and [[Alanine transaminase|ALT]]) are noted frequently (up to 27%). No case of symptomatic liver damage has ever been seen so far.
* Sensitivity reactions: [[Urticaria]], [[rash]], [[pruritus]] and [[eosinophilia]] in white blood cell counts
* Other locations/body as a whole: Lower back pain, myalgia, arthralgia, fever, sweating, various cardiac [[arrhythmias]], and [[hypotension]]

===Pregnancy===
Animal studies have failed to reveal evidence of fetal harm. There are no controlled data in human pregnancy. Praziquantel should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed; caution is recommended.

    <title>Verapamil</title>

The most common side effect of Verapamil is [[constipation]] (7.3%). Other side effects include: [[dizziness]] (3.3%), [[nausea]] (2.7%), [[low blood pressure]] (2.5%), and [[headache]] 2.2%. Other side effects seen in less than 2% of the population include: [[edema]], [[congestive heart failure]], [[pulmonary edema]], [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[elevated liver enzymes]], [[shortness of breath]], [[slow heart rate|low heart rate]], [[atrioventricular block]], [[rash]] and [[Flushing (physiology)|flushing]].
[[File:000726lg 24 HR Verelan 300 MG Extended Release Capsule.jpg|left|thumb|Verelan 300-mg extended-release capsule]]
Along with other calcium channel blockers, verapamil is known to induce [[gingival hyperplasia]].


===Overdose===
Acute overdose is often manifested by nausea, [[asthenia]], [[bradycardia]], dizziness, hypotension, and [[cardiac arrhythmia]]. Plasma, [[Serum (blood)|serum]], or blood concentrations of verapamil and norverapamil, its major active metabolite, may be measured to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of fatalities. Blood or plasma verapamil concentrations are usually in a range of 50-500 μg/l in persons on therapy with the drug, but may rise to 1–4&amp;nbsp;mg/l in acute overdose patients and are often at levels of 5–10&amp;nbsp;mg/l in fatal poisonings.

Adverse effects by frequency:
* History of hypersensitivity to fluorouracil, capecitabine or any of its excipients
* [[Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency|DPD deficiency]] (see [[#Pharmacogenetics|Pharmacogenetics]])
* Pregnancy and lactation
* Severe [[leucopenia]], [[neutropenia]], or [[thrombocytopenia]]
* Severe hepatic impairment or severe renal impairment
* Treatment with [[sorivudine]] or its chemically related analogues, such as [[brivudine]]

===Drug interactions===
Drugs it is known to interact with include:
* [[Sorivudine]] or its analogues, such as, [[brivudine]].
* [[CYP2C9]] substrates, including, [[warfarin]] and other coumarin-derivatives anticoagulants
* [[Phenytoin]], as it increases the plasma concentrations of phenytoin.
* [[Calcium folinate]] may enhance the therapeutic effects of capecitabine by means of synergising with its metabolite, 5-FU. It may also induce more severe diarrhoea by means of this synergy.

    <title>Ifosfamide</title>

Hemorrhagic cystitis is rare when ifosfamide is given with mesna. A common and dose-limiting side effect is [[encephalopathy]] (brain dysfunction). It occurs in some form in up to 50% of people receiving the agent. The reaction is probably mediated by [[chloroacetaldehyde]], one of the breakdown products of the ifosfamide molecule, which has chemical properties similar to [[acetaldehyde]] and [[chloral hydrate]]. The symptoms of ifosfamide encephalopathy can range from mild (difficulty concentrating, fatigue), to moderate ([[delirium]], [[psychosis]]), to severe ([[Status epilepticus#Nonconvulsive|nonconvulsive status epilepticus]] or [[coma]]). In children, this can interfere with neurological development. Apart from the brain, ifosfamide can also affect peripheral nerves. The severity of the reaction can be classified according to either the [[National Cancer Institute]] or the Meanwell criteria (grade I-IV). Previous brain problems and low levels of [[albumin]] in the blood increase the likelihood of ifosfamide encephalopathy. In most cases, the reaction resolves spontaneously within 72 hours. If it develops during an infusion of the drug, discontinuing the infusion is advised. The most effective treatment for severe (grade III-IV) encephalopathy is an intravenous solution of [[methylene blue]], which appears to shorten the duration of encephalopathy; the exact mechanism of action of methylene blue is unclear. In some cases, methylene blue may be used as a prophylaxis before further doses of ifosfamide are administered. Other treatments include albumin and [[thiamine]], and [[dialysis]] as a rescue modality.

Ifosfamide may also cause a [[normal anion gap acidosis]], specifically [[renal tubular acidosis]] type 2.

===Heart===
The primary side effect of phenylephrine is [[hypertension|high blood pressure]]. People with high blood pressure are typically advised to avoid  products containing it. Because this medication is a [[sympathomimetic]] amine without beta-adrenergic activity, it does not increase contractility force and output of the cardiac muscle. It may increase blood pressure resulting in a [[Reflex bradycardia|slow heart rate]] through stimulation of vascular (likely carotid) baroreceptors. A common side effect during IV administration is reflex bradycardia. The low concentration eye drops do not cause blood pressure changes and the changes with the higher dose drops do not last long.

===Other===
[[Prostatic hyperplasia]] can also be worsened by use, and chronic use can lead to rebound [[hyperemia]].

Extended use may cause [[rhinitis medicamentosa]], a condition of [[Rebound effect|rebound]] [[nasal congestion]].

===Interactions===
The increase in [[blood pressure]] effect of phenylephrine may be increased by drugs such as [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s, [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s, and [[hydrocortisone]].  Patients taking these medications may need a lower dose of phenylephrine to achieve a similar increase in blood pressure.

Drugs that may decrease the effects of phenylephrine may include [[calcium channel blockers]], [[ACE inhibitors]] and [[benzodiazepine]]s.  Patients taking these medications may need a higher dose of phenylephrine to achieve a comparable increase in blood pressure.

    <title>Aspirin</title>


===Contraindications===
&lt;!--Note that Contraindications is spelled correctly! It does not need to be changed.--&gt;
Aspirin should not be taken by people who are allergic to [[ibuprofen]] or [[naproxen]], People with [[hemophilia]] or other bleeding tendencies should not take aspirin or other salicylates. Aspirin is known to cause [[hemolytic anemia]] in people who have the genetic disease [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]], particularly in large doses and depending on the severity of the disease. Use of aspirin during [[dengue fever]] is not recommended owing to increased bleeding tendency. People with [[kidney disease]], [[hyperuricemia]], or [[gout]] should not take aspirin because it inhibits the kidneys' ability to excrete [[uric acid]], thus may exacerbate these conditions. Aspirin should not be given to children or adolescents to control cold or influenza symptoms, as this has been linked with [[Reye syndrome|Reye's syndrome]]. Combining aspirin with other [[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAIDs]] has also been shown to further increase this risk. Using aspirin in combination with clopidogrel or warfarin also increases the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Blockade of COX-1 by aspirin apparently results in the upregulation of COX-2 as part of a gastric defense and that taking COX-2 inhibitors concurrently with aspirin increases the gastric mucosal erosion. Therefore, caution should be exercised if combining aspirin with any &quot;natural&quot; supplements with COX-2-inhibiting properties, such as garlic extracts, curcumin, bilberry, pine bark, ginkgo, fish oil, resveratrol, genistein, quercetin, resorcinol, and others.

In addition to enteric coating, &quot;buffering&quot; is the other main method companies have used to try to mitigate the problem of gastrointestinal bleeding. Buffering agents are intended to work by preventing the aspirin from concentrating in the walls of the stomach, although the benefits of buffered aspirin are disputed. Almost any buffering agent used in antacids can be used; Bufferin, for example, uses [[magnesium oxide]]. Other preparations use [[calcium carbonate]].

Taking it with vitamin C is a more recently investigated method of protecting the stomach lining. &lt;!--According to research done at a German university, t--&gt;Taking equal doses of vitamin C and aspirin may decrease the amount of stomach damage that occurs compared to taking aspirin alone. The [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] now recommends aspirin (or aspirin-containing products) should not be given to anyone under the age of 12 who has a fever, and the UK [[National Health Service]] recommends children who are under 16 years of age should not take aspirin, unless it is on the advice of a doctor.

===Skin===
For a small number of people, taking aspirin can result in symptoms resembling an allergic reaction, including [[hives]], swelling, and headache. The reaction is caused by [[salicylate intolerance]] and is not a true [[allergy]], but rather an inability to metabolize even small amounts of aspirin, resulting in an [[#Overdose|overdose]].

Aspirin and other NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, may delay the healing of skin wounds. Aspirin may however help heal venous leg ulcers that have not healed following usual treatment.

===Other adverse effects===
Aspirin can induce [[angioedema|swelling of skin tissues]] in some people. In one study, [[angioedema]] appeared one to six hours after ingesting aspirin in some of the people. However, when the aspirin was taken alone, it did not cause angioedema in these people; the aspirin had been taken in combination with another NSAID-induced drug when angioedema appeared.

Aspirin causes an increased risk of cerebral microbleeds having the appearance on [[MRI]] scans of 5 to 10&amp;nbsp;mm or smaller, hypointense (dark holes) patches. Such cerebral microbleeds are important, since they often occur prior to [[ischemic stroke]] or [[intracerebral hemorrhage]], [[Binswanger disease]], and [[Alzheimer's disease]].{{Original research inline|date=March 2011}}

A study of a group with a mean dosage of aspirin of 270&amp;nbsp;mg per day estimated an average absolute risk increase in [[intracerebral hemorrhage]] (ICH) of 12 events per 10,000 persons. In comparison, the estimated absolute risk reduction in myocardial infarction was 137 events per 10,000 persons, and a reduction of 39 events per 10,000 persons in ischemic stroke. Aspirin is known to displace a number of drugs from protein-binding sites in the blood, including the [[antidiabetic drug]]s [[tolbutamide]] and [[chlorpropamide]], [[warfarin]], [[methotrexate]], [[phenytoin]], [[probenecid]], [[valproic acid]] (as well as interfering with [[beta oxidation]], an important part of valproate metabolism), and other NSAIDs. Corticosteroids may also reduce the concentration of aspirin. Ibuprofen can negate the antiplatelet effect of aspirin used for cardioprotection and stroke prevention. The pharmacological activity of [[spironolactone]] may be reduced by taking aspirin, and it is known to compete with [[Penicillin|penicillin G]] for renal tubular secretion. Aspirin may also inhibit the absorption of vitamin C.{{MEDRS|date=August 2016}}

    <title>Tetrazepam</title>

Allergic reactions to tetrazepam occasionally occur involving the skin.

Allergic reactions can develop to tetrazepam and it is considered to be a potential allergen. Drug rash and drug-induced [[eosinophilia]] with systemic symptoms is a known complication of tetrazepam exposure. These hypersensitive allergic reactions can be of the [[Type IV hypersensitivity|delayed type]].

[[Toxic epidermal necrolysis]] has occurred from the use of tetrazepam including at least one reported death. [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]] and [[erythema multiforme]] has been reported from use of tetrazepam. Cross-reactivity with other benzodiazepines does not typically occur in such patients. [[Exanthema]] and [[eczema]] may occur. The lack of cross-reactivity with other benzodiazepines is believed to be due to the molecular structure of tetrazepam.

===Tolerance, dependence and withdrawal===
{{See also|Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome}}
Prolonged use, as with all [[benzodiazepines]], should be avoided, as tolerance occurs and there is a risk of [[benzodiazepine dependence]] and a [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]] after stopping or reducing dosage.

The most commonly reported side effects of tapentadol therapy in clinical trials were nausea, vomiting, dizziness, sleepiness, itchiness, dry mouth, headache, and fatigue.

According to the World Health Organization there is little evidence to judge the abuse potential of tapentadol. the US DEA placed tapentadol into Schedule II, the same category as stronger opioids more commonly used recreationally, such as morphine, oxycodone, and [[fentanyl]].

Like its proto-drug, O-desmethyltramadol, tapentadol has been demonstrated to reduce the seizure threshold in patients. Tapentadol should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures, and in patients who are also taking one or more other drugs which have also been demonstrated to reduce the seizure threshold. Patients at high risk include those using other serotogenic and adrenergic medications, as well as patients with head trauma, metabolic disorders, and those in alcohol and/or drug withdrawals.

    <title>Eflornithine</title>

Eflornithine is not genotoxic; no tumour-inducing effects have been observed in carcinogenicity studies, including one photocarcinogenicity study. No teratogenic effects have been detected.

===Intravenous ===
The intravenous dosage form of eflornithine is sold under the brand name Ornidyl. Most side effects related to systemic use through injection are transient and reversible by discontinuing the drug or decreasing the dose. Hematologic abnormalities occur frequently, ranging from 10–55%. These abnormalities are dose-related and are usually reversible. [[Thrombocytopenia]] is thought to be due to a production defect rather than to peripheral destruction. [[Seizures]] were seen in approximately 8% of patients, but may be related to the disease state rather than the drug. Reversible hearing loss has occurred in 30–70% of patients receiving long-term therapy (more than 4–8 weeks of therapy or a total dose of &gt;300&amp;nbsp;grams); high-frequency hearing is lost first, followed by middle- and low-frequency hearing. Because treatment for African trypanosomiasis is short-term, patients are unlikely to experience hearing loss.

In the US, the capsule formulation (Cometriq) carries a [[black box warning]] of the risk of [[gastrointestinal perforation|holes forming in the stomach or intestines]] as well as formation of [[fistulas]] (tunnels between the GI tract and the skin).  The black box also warns against the risk of uncontrolled bleeding.  The tablet formulation (Cabometyx) warns of these effects as well.

The labels also warn of the risk of clots forming and causing heart attacks or strokes, high blood pressure including [[hypertensive crisis]], osteonecrosis of the jaw, severe diarrhea, [[Chemotherapy-induced acral erythema|skin sloughing off the palms and soles]], [[Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome|a syndrome with headaches, confusion, loss of vision, and seizures]], and protein appearing in urine.

Very common adverse effects (greater than 10% of people) include decreased appetite; low calcium, potassium, phosphate, and magnesium levels; high [[bilirubin]] levels; distorted sense of taste, headache, and dizziness; high blood pressure; distorted sense of hearing, earaches and sore throat; diarrhea, nausea, constipation, vomiting, stomach pain and upset stomach, and inflammation of the mouth and lips and a burning sensation in the mouth; skin sloughing off the palms and soles, hair color changes and hair loss, rash, dry skin, and red skin; joint pain and muscle spasms; fatigue and weakness; weight loss, [[elevated transaminases]], higher cholesterol levels, and loss of red and white blood cells.

Common adverse effects (between 1% and 10% of people) include abscesses (inside the body, on the skin, and in teeth skin), pneumonia, inflamed hair follicles, fungal infections, low thyroid levels, dehydration, loss of [[albumin]], anxiety, depression, and confusion, peripheral neuropathy, tingling, and tremor, tinnitus, atrial fibrillation, low blood pressure, blocked veins, paleness, chills, fistulas forming in the trachea and esophagus, blood clots in the lungs, and bleeding in the respiratory tract, GI perforation, bleeding in the stomach and intestines, pancreatitis, hemorrhoids, anal fissure, anal inflammation, gallstones, hard skin growths, acne, blisters, abnormal hair growth, loss of skin color and skin flaking, chest pain, blood or protein in urine, wounds that don't heal well, and facial swelling.

Like other aminoglycosides, tobramycin is [[ototoxicity|ototoxic]]: it can cause [[Hearing impairment|hearing loss]], or a loss of [[equilibrioception]], or both in genetically susceptible individuals. These individuals carry a normally harmless genetic mutation that allows aminoglycosides such as tobramycin to affect [[cochlea|cochlear cells]]. Aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity is generally irreversible.

As with all amino glycosides, tobramycin is also nephrotoxic, it can damage or destroy the tissue of the kidneys [3]. This effect can be particularly worrisome when multiple doses accumulate over the course of a treatment or when the kidney concentrates urine by increasing [[Renal physiology|tubular reabsorption]] during sleep. Adequate hydration may help prevent excess nephrotoxicity and subsequent loss of renal function. For these reasons [[wikt:parenteral|parenteral]] tobramycin needs to be carefully dosed by [[body weight]], and its serum concentration monitored. Tobramycin is thus said to be a drug with a narrow [[therapeutic index]].

    <title>Gabapentin</title>

The most common [[side effect]]s of gabapentin include [[dizziness]], [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[drowsiness]], [[ataxia]], [[peripheral edema]] (swelling of extremities), nystagmus, and [[tremor]]. Gabapentin may also produce [[sexual dysfunction]] in some patients, symptoms of which may include loss of [[libido]], inability to reach [[orgasm]], and [[erectile dysfunction]]. Gabapentin should be used carefully in patients with [[Renal failure|renal impairment]] due to possible accumulation and toxicity.

===Suicide===
In 2009 the [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] issued a warning of an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in patients taking some anticonvulsant drugs, including gabapentin, modifying the [[black box warning|packaging inserts]] to reflect this. A 2010 meta-analysis confirmed the increased risk of suicide associated with gabapentin use.

===Cancer===
An increase in formation of [[adenocarcinoma]]s was observed in rats during preclinical trials; however, the clinical significance of these results remains undetermined. Gabapentin is also known to induce [[pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma]]s in rats through an unknown mechanism, perhaps by stimulation of DNA synthesis; these tumors did not affect the lifespan of the rats and did not [[metastasize]].

The most common adverse events with didanosine are [[diarrhea]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[abdominal pain]], [[fever]], [[headache]] and [[rash]]. Peripheral [[neuropathy]] occurred in 21-26% of participants in key didanosine trials.

[[Pancreatitis]] is rarely observed but has caused occasional fatalities, and has [[black box warning]] status. Other reported serious adverse events are retinal changes, [[optic neuritis]] and alterations of liver functions. The risk of some of these serious adverse events is increased by drinking alcohol.

In February 2010, the United States Food and Drug Administration issued a statement that patients using Didanosine (Videx) are at risk for a rare
but potentially fatal liver disorder, non-cirrhotic portal hypertension.

    <title>Cangrelor</title>

Despite fewer bleeding events during cardiac surgery, cangrelor carries the risk of potential autoimmune reactions manifesting as breathlessness. The dyspnea risks following cangrelor treatment, suggest a common mechanism linking transfusion-related acute lung injury, dyspnea, and reversible platelet inhibition.

The risk of [[breathlessness]] after intravenous cangrelor is smaller when compared with other reversible platelet [[Adenosine diphosphate receptor inhibitor|P2Y&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; receptor inhibitors]], however, it is still significantly higher when compared to irreversible oral antiplatelet drugs or intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors; which do not increase the incidence of breathlessness at all.

    <title>Fentanyl</title>

Fentanyl's most common side effects (more than 10% of patients) include diarrhea, nausea, constipation, dry mouth, [[somnolence]], confusion, [[asthenia]] (weakness), sweating, and less frequently (3 to 10% of patients) abdominal pain, headache, fatigue, anorexia and weight loss, dizziness, nervousness, hallucinations, anxiety, depression, flu-like symptoms, [[dyspepsia]] (indigestion), [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]], [[hypoventilation]], [[apnoea]], and urinary retention. Fentanyl use has also been associated with [[aphasia]].

Despite being a more potent analgesic, fentanyl tends to induce less nausea, as well as less [[histamine]]-mediated itching, than morphine.

Fentanyl may produce more prolonged [[respiratory depression]] than other opioid analgesics. In 2006 the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) began investigating several respiratory deaths, but doctors in the United Kingdom were not warned of the risks with fentanyl until September 2008. The FDA reported in April 2012 that twelve young children had died and twelve more made seriously ill from separate accidental exposures to fentanyl skin patches.

The precise reason for sudden respiratory depression is unclear, but there are several hypotheses:
* Saturation of the body fat compartment in patients with rapid and profound body fat loss (patients with cancer, cardiac or infection-induced [[cachexia]] can lose 80% of their body fat).
* Early carbon dioxide retention causing cutaneous vasodilation (releasing more fentanyl), together with acidosis, which reduces protein binding of fentanyl, releasing yet more fentanyl.
* Reduced sedation, losing a useful early warning sign of opioid toxicity and resulting in levels closer to respiratory-depressant levels.

Fentanyl has a [[therapeutic index]] of 270.

    <title>Doxylamine</title>

Doxylamine succinate is a potent [[anticholinergic]] and has a [[adverse drug reaction|side-effect]] profile common to such drugs, including [[Xerostomia|dry mouth]], [[ataxia]], [[urinary retention]], drowsiness, memory problems, inability to concentrate, hallucinations, psychosis, and a marked increased sensitivity to external stimuli. Like many hypnotics, it should not be combined with other antihistamines,{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} such as [[cetirizine]] (Zyrtec) or [[diphenhydramine]] (Benadryl), as this combination can increase the risk of serious side effects. Using doxylamine over a long period of time is not recommended. However, the drug is not addictive, and withdrawal effects are unlikely to be experienced with prolonged use.

Because of its relatively long [[elimination half-life]] (10–12&amp;nbsp;hours), doxylamine is associated with daytime/next-day [[drowsiness]], [[grogginess]], [[dry mouth]], and [[tiredness]] when used as a [[hypnotic]].

===Toxicity===
Doxylamine succinate is generally safe for administration to healthy adults. The median lethal dose ({{LD50}}) is estimated to be 50–500&amp;nbsp;mg/kg in humans. Symptoms of overdose may include dry mouth, dilated pupils, insomnia, night terrors, euphoria, hallucinations, seizures, [[rhabdomyolysis]], and death. Fatalities have been reported from doxylamine overdose. These have been characterized by [[coma]], [[tonic-clonic seizures|tonic-clonic (or grand mal) seizures]] and [[cardiorespiratory arrest]]. Children appear to be at a high risk for cardiorespiratory arrest. A toxic dose for children of more than 1.8&amp;nbsp;mg/kg has been reported. A 3-year old child died 18 hours after ingesting 1,000&amp;nbsp;mg doxylamine succinate. Rarely, an overdose results in [[rhabdomyolysis]] and acute [[renal failure]].

Studies of doxylamine's [[carcinogenicity]] in mice and rats have produced positive results for both liver and thyroid cancer, especially in the mouse. The carcinogenicity of the drug in humans is not well studied, and the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|IARC]] lists the drug as &quot;not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans&quot;.

    <title>Etomidate</title>

Etomidate suppresses [[corticosteroid]] synthesis in the adrenal cortex by reversibly inhibiting [[Steroid 11β-hydroxylase|11β-hydroxylase]], an enzyme important in adrenal steroid production; it leads to primary adrenal suppression.

Because of etomidate-induced adrenal suppression, its use for patients with sepsis is controversial. Cortisol levels have been reported to be suppressed up to 72 hours after a single bolus of etomidate in this population at risk for adrenal insufficiency. For this reason, many authors have suggested that etomidate should never be used for critically ill patients with septic shock However, other authors continue to defend etomidate's use for septic patients because of etomidate's safe hemodynamic profile and lack of clear evidence of harm. A study by Jabre et al. showed that a single dose of etomidate used for Rapid Sequence Induction prior to endrotracheal intubation has no effect on mortality compared to ketamine even though etomidate did cause transient adrenal suppression. In addition, a recent meta-analysis done by Hohl could not conclude that etomidate increased mortality. The authors of this meta-analysis concluded more studies were needed because of lack of statistical power to conclude definitively about the effect of etomidate on mortality. Thus, Hohl suggests a burden to prove etomidate is safe for use in septic patients, and more research is needed before it is used. Other authors in patients undergoing colorectal surgery has verified the safety of giving stress dose corticosteroids to all patients receiving etomidate.

In a retrospective review of almost 32,000 people, etomidate, when used for the induction of anaesthesia, was associated 2.5-fold increase in the risk of dying compared with those given [[propofol]]. People given etomidate also had significantly greater odds of having cardiovascular morbidity and significantly longer hospital stay. These results, especially given the large size of study, strongly suggest that, at the very least, clinicians should use etomidate judiciously. The clinical impact of this effect has yet to be determined.

In addition, concurrent use of etomidate with [[opioids]] and/or [[benzodiazepines]], is hypothesized to exacerbate etomidate-related adrenal insufficiency. However, only retrospective evidence of this effect exists and prospective studies are needed to measure the clinical impact of this interaction.

Common adverse events considered to be drug-related were [[hot flash]]es and [[leg cramp]]s. It does not appear to affect [[cognition]] or [[memory]]. Raloxifene is a [[teratology|teratogen]]; i.e., it can cause developmental abnormalities such as [[birth defect]]s.

Raloxifene may infrequently cause serious [[thrombus|blood clot]]s to form in the legs, lungs, or eyes. Other reactions experienced include leg swelling/pain, trouble breathing, chest pain, and vision changes. Black box warnings were added to the label of raloxifene in 2007 warning of increased risk of death due to stroke for postmenopausal women with documented coronary heart disease or at increased risk for major coronary events, as well as increased risks for [[deep vein thrombosis]] and [[pulmonary embolism]].

A report in September 2009 from Health and Human Services' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality suggests that tamoxifen and raloxifene, used to treat breast cancer, significantly reduce invasive breast cancer in midlife and older women, but also increase the risk of adverse side effects.

A recent human case report in July 2016 suggests that raloxifene may in fact, at some point, also stimulate breast cancer growth leading to a reduction of advanced breast cancer disease upon the withdrawal of the drug.

Fycompa’s label has a [[black box warning]] noting that some people taking the drug have undergone serious psychiatric and behavioral changes. These events occurred in people who had no history of such issues, as well as people who had such a history.  The psychiatric changes included mood changes like euphoric mood, anger, irritability, aggression, belligerence, agitation, and anxiety, as well as psychosis (acute psychosis, hallucinations, delusions, paranoia) and delirium (delirium, confusional state, disorientation, memory impairment).  Behavioral changes included physical assault and homicidal ideation and/or threats.

Other serious side effects include suicidal thoughts or behavior (like all anti-epileptic drugs), dizziness and gait disturbance, somnolence and fatigue, risk of falls, and increased risk of seizures if the drug is quickly withdrawn.

In clinical trials, dizziness, somnolence, vertigo, aggression, anger, [[ataxia|loss of coordination]], blurred vision, irritability, and [[dysarthria|slurred speech]] were the side effects that most commonly led people to leave the trial.

Perampanel is liable to be abused; very high doses produced euphoria responses similar to [[ketamine]], although subjects liked it less and had experienced it more negatively than ketamine; it produced dissociative effects similar to ketamine. It is designated as a Schedule III [[controlled substance]] by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]]. A study of [[Substance dependence|dependence]] in rats found withdrawal symptoms when the drug was removed; dependence in humans wasn't studied well enough to make generalizations as of April 2016.  There is limited experience with overdose.

{{Main article|ACE inhibitor#Adverse effects}}

Adverse effects of captopril include cough due to increase in the plasma levels of bradykinin, [[angioedema]], [[agranulocytosis]], [[proteinuria]], [[hyperkalemia]], [[dysgeusia|taste alteration]], [[teratogen]]icity, [[postural hypotension]], [[acute renal failure]], and [[leukopenia]].
Except for postural hypotension, which occurs due to short and fast mode of action of captopril, most of the side effects mentioned are common for all ACE inhibitors. Among these, cough is the most common adverse effect. [[Hyperkalemia]] can occur, especially if used with other drugs which elevate potassium level in blood, such as potassium-sparing [[diuretics]]. Other side effects are:

* [[Itching]]
* [[Headache]]
* [[Tachycardia]]
* [[Chest pain]]
* [[Palpitations]]
* [[Weakness]]

    <title>Mifepristone</title>

Nearly all women using the mifepristone/misoprostol regimen experienced abdominal pain, uterine cramping, and vaginal bleeding or spotting for an average of 9–16 days. Up to 8% of women experienced some type of bleeding for 30 days or more. Other less common side effects included [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], diarrhea, dizziness, fatigue, and [[fever]]. Mifepristone is [[Contraindication|contraindicated]] in the presence of an [[intrauterine device]], as well as with [[ectopic pregnancy]], [[Adrenal gland|adrenal]] failure, [[Bleeding|hemorrhagic]] disorders, inherited [[porphyria]], and [[anticoagulant]] or long-term [[corticosteroid]] therapy.

The FDA prescribing information states no data are available on the safety and efficacy of mifepristone in women with chronic medical conditions, and &quot;women who are more than 35 years of age and who also smoke 10 or more cigarettes per day should be treated with caution because such patients were generally excluded from clinical trials of mifepristone.&quot;

A postmarketing summary found, of about 1.52 million women who had received mifepristone until April 2011 in the United States, 14 were reported to have died after application. Eight of these cases were associated with [[sepsis]]; the other six had various causes such as drug abuse and suspected murder. Other incidents reported to the FDA included 612 nonlethal hospitalizations, 339 blood transfusions, 48 severe infections, and 2,207 (0.15%) adverse events altogether.

===Cancer===
No long-term studies to evaluate the [[carcinogenic]] potential of mifepristone have been performed. This is in accord with ICH guidelines, which do not require carcinogencity testing in nongenotoxic drugs intended for administration for less than six months.

===Pregnancy===
Mifepristone alone results in abortion within 1–2 weeks in 8% to 46% of pregnancies. Though some [[pro-life]] groups claim otherwise.

Exposure to a single large dose of mifepristone in newborn rats was not associated with any reproductive problems, although chronic low-dose exposure of newborn rats to mifepristone was associated with structural and functional reproductive abnormalities.

Studies in mice, rats, and rabbits revealed teratogenicity for rabbits, but not rats or mice. The rate of birth defects in human infants exposed ''[[in utero]]'' to mifepristone and misoprostol is very low, and may be due to misoprostol alone.

Nifedipine rapidly lowers blood pressure, and patients are commonly warned they may feel dizzy or faint after taking the first few doses. [[Tachycardia]] (fast heart rate) may occur as a reaction. These problems are much less frequent in the sustained-release preparations of nifedipine.

Extended release formulations of nifedipine should be taken on an empty stomach, and patients are warned not to consume anything containing [[grapefruit]] or grapefruit juice, as they raise blood nifedipine levels. There are several possible mechanisms, including the lowering of [[CYP3A4]] activity.

Common adverse effects of acetazolamide include the following: [[paraesthesia]], fatigue, drowsiness, depression, decreased libido, bitter or metallic taste, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, black feces, [[polyuria]], [[kidney stones]], [[metabolic acidosis]] and electrolyte changes ([[hypokalemia]], [[hyponatremia]]).

===Contraindications===
Contraindications include:
* [[Amphetamine]]s, due to the fact it increases the pH of the renal tubular urine, hence reducing the clearance of amphetamines.
* Other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors — potential for additive inhibitory effects on carbonic anhydrase and hence potential for toxicity. 
* [[Ciclosporin]], may increase plasma levels of ciclosporin.
* [[Antifolate]]s such as [[trimethoprim]], [[methotrexate]], [[pemetrexed]] and [[raltitrexed]].
* [[Hypoglycemic]]s, acetazolamide can both increase or decrease blood glucose levels.
* [[Lithium (medication)|Lithium]], increases excretion, hence reducing therapeutic effect.
* [[Methenamine]] compounds, reduces the urinary excretion of methenamines.
* [[Phenytoin]], reduces phenytoin excretion, hence increasing the potential for toxicity.
* [[Primidone]], reduces plasma levels of primidone. Hence reducing anticonvulsant effect.
* [[Quinidine]], reduces urinary excretion of quinidine, hence increasing the potential for toxicity.
* [[Salicylates]], potential for severe toxicity.
* [[Sodium bicarbonate]], potential for kidney stone formation.
* [[Anticoagulants]], [[cardiac glycosides]], may have their effects potentiated by acetazolamide.

    <title>Omeprazole</title>

The most frequent significant adverse effects occurring in at least 1% of patients include:
*Central nervous system: headache (7%), dizziness (2%)
*Respiratory: [[upper respiratory tract infection]] (2%), cough (1%)
*Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain (5%), diarrhea (4%), nausea (4%), vomiting (3%), flatulence (3%), acid regurgitation (2%), constipation (2%)
*Neuromuscular and skeletal: back pain (1%), weakness (1%)
*Dermatologic: rash (2%)
Other concerns related to adverse effects are:
*Recurrence of ''[[Clostridium difficile colitis|Clostridium difficile]]'' associated diarrhea
*[[osteoporosis#Fractures|Osteoporosis-related fractures]]
*[[Hypomagnesemia]]

Concern has been expressed regarding [[vitamin B12|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[iron]] malabsorption, but effects seem to be insignificant, especially when supplement therapy is provided.

Since their introduction, proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs, especially omeprazole) have also been associated with several cases of [[acute interstitial nephritis]], an inflammation of the [[kidneys]] that often occurs as an adverse drug reaction.

Long-term use of PPIs is strongly associated with the development of benign [[polyp (medicine)|polyps]] from [[fundic glands]] (which is distinct from [[fundic gland polyposis]]); these polyps do not cause cancer and resolve when PPIs are discontinued. No association is seen between PPI use and cancer, but use of PPIs may mask gastric cancers or other serious gastric problems and physicians should be aware of this effect.

There is a tentative association between long term use and dementia which requires further study to confirm.

===Pregnancy and breast-feeding===
Epidemiological data do not show an increased risk of major birth defects after maternal use of omeprazole during [[pregnancy]].

No [[clinical studies|clinical trials]] have deeply evaluated the potential consequences of the use of omeprazole in breastfeeding. However, the pharmacokinetics of omeprazole molecule strongly suggest the safety of omeprazole use during breastfeeding:
* Omeprazole has a high plasma protein binding rate (95%), indicating that little amount of drug is transferred to the [[milk duct]] during breast milk formation.
* Omeprazole needs to be administrated in an enteric-coated formulation due to its rapid degradation in the acidic conditions of the stomach. This suggests that most of the free molecules ingested by the infant are likely degraded before being absorbed.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Omeprazole at normal doses is likely safe during breastfeeding.

 effects may include allergic reactions, [[vitamin B]] insufficiency, [[agranulocytosis]] and aplastic anemia.

    <title>Linezolid</title>

When used for short periods, linezolid is a relatively safe drug. Common [[Adverse drug reaction|side effects]] of linezolid use (those occurring in more than 1% of people taking linezolid) include diarrhea (reported by 3–11% of clinical trial participants), headache (1–11%), nausea (3–10%), vomiting (1–4%), rash (2%), constipation (2%), altered taste perception (1–2%), and discoloration of the tongue (0.2–1%). Fungal infections such as [[Oral candidiasis|thrush]] and [[candidal vulvovaginitis|vaginal candidiasis]] may also occur as linezolid suppresses normal bacterial flora and opens a niche for fungi (so-called [[antibiotic candidiasis]]). Less common (and potentially more serious) adverse effects include allergic reactions, [[pancreatitis]], and [[elevated transaminases]], which may be a sign of liver damage.

Like nearly all antibiotics, linezolid has been associated with [[Clostridium difficile colitis|''Clostridium difficile''-associated diarrhea]] (CDAD) and [[pseudomembranous colitis]], although the latter is uncommon, occurring in about one in two thousand patients in clinical trials. ''C. difficile'' appears to be susceptible to linezolid ''in vitro'', and linezolid was even considered as a possible treatment for CDAD.

===Long-term use===
[[Bone marrow suppression]], characterized particularly by [[thrombocytopenia]] (low platelet count), may occur during linezolid treatment; it appears to be the only adverse effect that occurs [[statistical significance|significantly]] more frequently with linezolid than with glycopeptides or beta-lactams. It is uncommon in patients who receive the drug for 14 days or fewer, but occurs much more frequently in patients who receive longer courses or who have renal failure. A 2004 [[case report]] suggested that [[pyridoxine]] (a form of [[vitamin B6|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]]) could reverse the anemia and thrombocytopenia caused by linezolid, but a later, larger study found no protective effect.

Long-term use of linezolid has also been associated with [[chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy]], a progressive and enduring often irreversible tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes involving the arms and legs. and [[optic neuropathy]], which is most common after several months of treatment and may also be irreversible. A more extensive monitoring protocol for early detection of toxicity in seriously ill patients receiving linezolid has been developed and proposed by a team of researchers in Melbourne, Australia. The protocol includes twice-weekly blood tests and [[liver function tests]]; measurement of serum [[lactic acid|lactate]] levels, for early detection of lactic acidosis; a review of all medications taken by the patient, interrupting the use of those that may [[drug interaction|interact]] with linezolid; and periodic eye and neurological exams in patients set to receive linezolid for longer than four weeks.

The adverse effects of long-term linezolid therapy were first identified during postmarketing surveillance. Bone marrow suppression was not identified during Phase III trials, in which treatment did not exceed 21 days. Although some participants of early trials did experience thrombocytopenia, it was found to be reversible and did not occur significantly more frequently than in controls (participants not taking linezolid). There have also been postmarketing reports of [[seizure]]s, and, {{as of|2009|lc=on}}, a single case each of [[Bell's palsy]] (paralysis of the [[facial nerve]]) and [[nephrotoxicity|kidney toxicity]].

    <title>Retigabine</title>

The [[adverse drug reaction|adverse effects]] found in the Phase II trial mainly affected the central nervous system, and appeared to be dose-related. The most common adverse effects were [[somnolence|drowsiness]], [[dizziness]], [[tinnitus]] and [[vertigo]], confusion, and [[dysarthria|slurred speech]]. Less common side effects included [[tremor]], memory loss, [[gait]] disturbances, and [[diplopia|double vision]].
In 2013 FDA warned the public that, Potiga (ezogabine) can cause blue skin discoloration and eye abnormalities characterized by pigment changes in the retina. FDA does not currently know if these changes are reversible. FDA is working with the manufacturer to gather and evaluate all available information to better understand these events. FDA will update the public when more information is available.

    <title>Moclobemide</title>

The incidence of adverse events is not correlated with age; however, adverse events occur more often in females than in males. The tolerability of moclobemide is similar in women and men and it is also well tolerated in the elderly. as well as not causing weight gain. Other side effects include, nausea, insomnia, tremor and lightheadedness; [[orthostatic hypotension]] (dizziness upon standing) is uncommon even among the elderly. Behavioural toxicity or other impairments relating to everyday living does not occur with moclobemide, except in doses of 400&amp;nbsp;mg or higher, peripheral reaction time may be impaired.

Moclobemide is relatively well tolerated. The following are the potential adverse effects and their respective incidences:

* Confusional states
* Bipolar disorder (although it seems less likely than imipramine to cause a manic switch)
* [[Phaeochromocytoma]]

and ''caution'' is recommended in: and, in fact, moclobemide causes a reduction in alcohol-related impairments. [[Ephedrine]] in combination with moclobemide increases the risk of cardiovascular adverse effects. Blood plasma levels of [[trimipramine]] and [[maprotiline]] and possibly other tricyclic antidepressants increase when used in combination with moclobemide and may require dosage adjustments if the combination is used for treatment resistant depression. The reversible binding to MAO-A by moclobemide allows amines such as tyramine to displace moclobemide from MAO-A allowing its metabolism and removing the risk of a hypertensive crisis that occurs with irreversible MAO inhibition. As the pressor effect of moclobemide is so low, dietary restrictions are not necessary in people eating a normal diet, in contrast to irreversible MAOIs. However, some rare cheeses that have a high tyramine level may possibly cause a pressor effect and require caution. The combined use of moclobemide and [[selegiline]] requires dietary restrictions as the combination can lead to increased sensitivity to the pressor effect of foods containing tyramine. making it a safer antidepressant in the elderly or people with physical disorders. Of 18 people who overdosed on moclobemide during clinical trials, all recovered fully and moclobemide was judged to be safe for in as well as outpatient use.

Moclobemide does not seem to prevent withdrawal symptoms from [[serotonin reuptake inhibitors]].

US drug regulators added warning to the ''nasal sprays'' after two people died and fifty-nine other people had seizures. This occurred due to [[hyponatremia]], a deficit of the body's sodium levels, and the nasal spray is no longer approved for use in children in the United States. However, US drug regulators have said that desmopressin tablets can still be considered safe for treatment of nocturnal enuresis in children as long as the person is otherwise healthy.

Patients must stop taking desmopressin if they develop severe vomiting and diarrhea, fever, the flu, or severe cold. Patients should also be very cautious about taking desmopressin during hot weather conditions or following strenuous exercise, as these conditions can place stress on the body's electrolyte and water balance.

A body needs to maintain a balance of water and ([[sodium]]).  If sodium levels become too low ([[hyponatremia]]) – either as a result of increased water take-up or reduced salt levels – a person may have [[seizures]] and, in extreme cases, may die.

    <title>Protriptyline</title>

Protriptyline shares side effects common to all TCAs. The most frequent of these are dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, increased heart rate, sedation, irritability, dizziness, decreased coordination, anxiety, blood disorders, confusion, decreased libido, dizziness, flushing, headache, impotence, insomnia, low blood pressure, nightmares, rapid or irregular heartbeat, rash, seizures, sensitivity to sunlight, stomach and intestinal problems. Other more complicated side effects include; chest pain or heavy feeling, pain spreading to the arm or shoulder, nausea, sweating, general ill feeling; sudden numbness or weakness, especially on one side of the body; sudden headache, confusion, problems with vision, speech, or balance; [[hallucinations]], or [[seizure]] (convulsions); easy bruising or bleeding, unusual weakness; restless muscle movements in your eyes, tongue, jaw, or neck; urinating less than usual or not at all; extreme thirst with headache, nausea, vomiting, and weakness; or feeling light-headed or fainting.
 
Dry mouth, if severe to the point of causing difficulty speaking or swallowing, may be managed by dosage reduction or temporary discontinuation of the drug. Patients may also chew sugarless gum or suck on sugarless candy in order to increase the flow of saliva. Some artificial saliva products may give temporary relief. 
Men with prostate enlargement who take protriptyline may be especially likely to have problems with urinary retention. Symptoms include having difficulty starting a urine flow and more difficulty than usual passing urine. In most cases, urinary retention is managed with dose reduction or by switching to another type of antidepressant. In extreme cases, patients may require treatment with bethanechol, a drug that reverses this particular side effect.

A common problem with TCAs is [[sedation]] (drowsiness, lack of physical and mental alertness), but protriptyline is considered the least sedating agent among this class of agents. Its side effects are especially noticeable early in therapy. In most people, early TCA side effects decrease or disappear entirely with time, but, until then, patients taking protriptyline should take care to assess which side effects occur in them and should not perform hazardous activities requiring mental acuity or coordination.

* [[Neuroleptic malignant syndrome]] a rare and potentially fatal complication of antipsychotic drug treatment. It is characterised by the following symptoms: tremor, rigidity, hyperthermia, tachycardia, mental status changes (e.g. confusion), etc.
* [[Tardive Dyskinesia]]. A rare and often irreversible neurological condition characterised by involuntary movements of the face, tongue, lips and rest of the body. Most commonly occurs after prolonged treatment with antipsychotics. It is believed to be particularly uncommon with atypical antipsychotics, especially quetiapine and clozapine
{{colend}}

Both typical and atypical antipsychotics can cause [[tardive dyskinesia]]. Although quetiapine and clozapine are atypical antipsychotics, switching to these atypicals is an option to minimize symptoms of tardive dyskinesia caused by other atypicals.

Weight gain can be a problem for some, with quetiapine causing more weight gain than [[fluphenazine]], [[haloperidol]], [[loxapine]], [[molindone]], [[olanzapine]], [[pimozide]], [[risperidone]], [[thioridazine]], [[thiothixene]], [[trifluoperazine]], and [[ziprasidone]], but less than [[chlorpromazine]], [[clozapine]], [[perphenazine]], and [[sertindole]].

Studies conducted on [[beagle]]s have resulted in the formation of [[cataract]]s. While there are reports of cataracts occurring in humans, controlled studies including thousands of patients have not demonstrated a clear causal association between quetiapine therapy and this side-effect.{{Citation needed|reason=Reference needed to April 2006 results of CATIE study.|date=September 2011}} However, the Seroquel website still recommends users have eye examinations every six months.

As with some other anti-psychotics, quetiapine may lower the [[seizure threshold]], and should be taken with caution in combination with drugs such as [[bupropion]].

===Discontinuation and withdrawal===
Quetiapine should be discontinued gradually, with careful consideration from the prescribing doctor, to avoid withdrawal symptoms or relapse.

The [[British National Formulary]] recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing anti-psychotic treatment to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Some have argued that additional somatic and psychiatric symptoms associated with dopaminergic super-sensitivity, including dyskinesia and acute psychosis, are common features of withdrawal in individuals treated with neuroleptics.   The present evidence suggests that these symptoms affect a small number of susceptible individuals treated with quetiapine. The evidence is insufficient to rule out any risk to the foetus but available data suggests it is unlikely to result in any major foetal malformations. It is secreted in breast milk and hence quetiapine-treated mothers are advised not to breastfeed.

===Suicide===
The US Food and Drug Administration body (FDA) requires all antidepressants, including venlafaxine, to carry a [[black box warning]] with a generic warning about a possible suicide risk.

A 2014 meta analysis of 21 clinical trials of venlafaxine for the treatment of depression in adults found that compared to placebo, venlafaxine reduced the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior.

A study conducted in Finland followed more than 15,000 patients for 3.4 years. Venlafaxine increased suicide risk by 60% (statistically significant), as compared to no treatment. At the same time, [[fluoxetine]] (Prozac) halved the suicide risk. venlafaxine caused a statistically significant 5-fold increase in suicidal ideation and behaviour in persons younger than 25. In another analysis, venlafaxine was no better than placebo among children (7–11 years old), but improved depression in adolescents (12–17 years old). However, in both groups, hostility and suicidal behaviour increased in comparison to those receiving a placebo.

====Pregnant women====
There are few well-controlled studies of venlafaxine in pregnant women. A study released in May 2010 by the Canadian Medical Association Journal suggests use of venlafaxine doubles the risk of [[miscarriage]]. Consequently, venlafaxine should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed. A large case-control study done as part of the National Birth Defects Prevention Study and published in 2012 found a significant association of venlafaxine use during pregnancy and several birth defects including anencephaly, cleft palate, septal heart defects and coarctation of the aorta. Prospective studies have not shown any statistically significant [[congenital malformation]]s. There have, however, been some reports of self-limiting effects on newborn infants. As with other [[serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SRIs), these effects are generally short-lived, lasting only 3 to 5 days, and rarely resulting in severe complications.

===Drug interactions===
Venlafaxine should be taken with caution when using [[Hypericum perforatum|St John's wort]]. Venlafaxine may lower the seizure threshold, and coadministration with other drugs that lower the seizure threshold such as [[bupropion]] and [[tramadol]] should be done with caution and at low doses.

===Bipolar disorder===
Venlafaxine is neither recommended nor approved for the treatment of major depressive episodes in [[bipolar disorder]] as it can induce [[mania]] or [[mixed episodes]]. Venlafaxine appears to be more likely than the [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRIs]] and [[bupropion]] to induce mania and mixed episodes in bipolar patients.

===Other===
There have been false positive [[phencyclidine]] (PCP) results caused by larger doses of venlafaxine, with certain on-site routine urine-based drug tests.

In rare cases, drug-induced [[akathisia]] can occur after use in some people.

Docetaxel is a cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent. As with all chemotherapy, adverse effects are common, and many side effects have been documented. Because docetaxel is a cell-cycle-specific agent, it is cytotoxic to all dividing cells in the body.

Haematological adverse effects include [[neutropenia]] (95.5%), [[anaemia]] (90.4%), [[febrile]] [[neutropenia]] (11.0%) and [[thrombocytopenia]] (8.0%). Deaths due to toxicity accounted for 1.7% of the 2045 patients, and incidence was increased (9.8%) in patients with elevated baseline liver function tests (liver dysfunction).

Observations of severe side effects in the above 40 phase II and phase III studies were also recorded.

Many more side effects have been reported for conjunctive and adjuvant treatment with docetaxel as well as rare post-marketing events.

===Contraindications and patient factors===
Docetaxel is contraindicated for use with patients with a baseline neutrophil count less than 1500 cells/µL, a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to docetaxel or polysorbate 80, severe liver impairment and pregnant or breast-feeding women.

Side effects are experienced more frequently by patients of 65 years or older, but dosage is usually not decreased. Renal failure is thought not to be a significant factor for docetaxel dosage adjustment. Patients with hepatic insufficiency resulting in serum bilirubin greater than the upper limit of normal (ULN) should not be administered docetaxel, though this is not a stated contraindication. Dosage should be reduced by 20% in people who develop; grade 3 or 4 diarrhea following exposure to docetaxel, hepatotoxicity defined by liver enzymes at levels greater than five times the ULN, and grade 2 palmer-planter toxicity.

Paediatric trials of docetaxel have been limited, and so safety of use in patients under 16 years has not been established.

===Pregnancy===
Based on the limited data available, docetaxel appears to be safe in pregnancy if administered during the second and third trimesters; however, maternal and fetal risks should be weighed against benefits to determine the appropriate course of action. Further studies are needed to better assess the safety of docetaxel in pregnancy and determine appropriate dosing in pregnant women.

===Drug interactions===
Drug interactions may be the result of altered pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics due to one of the drugs involved.  [[Cisplatin]], [[dexamethasone]], [[doxorubicin]], [[etoposide]], and [[vinblastine]] are all potentially co-administered with docetaxel and did not modify docetaxel plasma binding in phase II studies. Cisplatin is known to have a complex interaction with some CYPs and has in some events been shown to reduce docetaxel clearance by up to 25%. Anticonvulsants induce some metabolic pathways relevant to docetaxel. CYP450 and CYP3A show increased expression in response to the use of anticonvulsants and the metabolism of docetaxel metabolite M4 is processed by these CYPs. A corresponding increase in clearance of M4 by 25% is observed in patients taking phenytoin and phenobarbital, common anticonvulsants.

Erythromycin, ketoconazole and cyclosporine are CYP3A4 inhibitors and therefore inhibit the metabolic pathway of docetaxel. When used with anticonvulsants, which induce CYP3A4, an increased dose of docetaxel may be required.

Pre-treatment with corticosteroids has been used to decrease hypersensitivity reactions and oedema in response to docetaxel and has shown no effect on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel. The efficacy of docetaxel was improved by treatment with oral capecitabine, and after more than 27 months follow-up the survival benefit has been confirmed. Doxorubicin was combined with docetaxel in one study of 24 patients and resulted in an increased AUC of docetaxel by 50 to 70%, indicating doxorubicin may affect the disposition of docetaxel. Etoposide has also been shown to decrease docetaxel clearance, though patient numbers for this observation have been low.

Prednisone given with docetaxel led to improved survival, quality of life and pain management in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer.

The [[side effects]] of Adderall are many and varied, but the amount of substance consumed is the primary factor in determining the likelihood and severity of side effects. Adderall is currently approved for long-term therapeutic use by the USFDA. [[Recreational drug use#Stimulants|Recreational use]] of Adderall generally involves far larger doses and is therefore significantly more dangerous, involving a much greater risk of serious side effects.

    <title>Apixaban</title>

Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including apixaban, increases thrombotic event risk. This is not due to any rebound effect from discontinuation. To reduce this risk, administering another anticoagulant is advised.

One concern with the use of apixaban and the other newer anticoagulants is the absence of well-established protocol for reversal of their activity (no antidote is available).  This is an important disadvantage relative to warfarin when bleeding complications occur or when people taking the drugs require emergency surgery.

===Spinal puncture===
When spinal/epidural anesthesia or puncture is utilized, patients who are being treated with anti-thrombotic agents for the prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk for developing a [[hematoma]], which can cause long-term or permanent paralysis. The risk of this may be increased by using epidural or intrathecal [[catheter]]s after a surgical operation or from the concurrent use of medicinal agents that affect [[hemostasis]].

Very rarely, elongation of the QT interval may occur, increasing the risk of potentially fatal arrhythmias.

===Interactions===
Consuming food prior to taking chlorpromazine orally limits its absorption, likewise cotreatment with [[benztropine]] can also reduce chlorpromazine absorption. [[Ethanol|Alcohol]] can also reduce chlorpromazine absorption. Antacids slow chlorpromazine absorption. [[Lithium (medication)|Lithium]] and chronic treatment with [[barbiturates]] can increase chlorpromazine clearance significantly. [[Tricyclic antidepressants]] (TCAs) can decrease chlorpromazine clearance and hence increase chlorpromazine exposure. Cotreatment with [[CYP1A2]] inhibitors like [[ciprofloxacin]], [[fluvoxamine]] or [[vemurafenib]] can reduce chlorpromazine clearance and hence increase exposure and potentially also adverse effects. Chlorpromazine can also potentiate the CNS depressant effects of drugs like [[barbiturates]], [[benzodiazepines]], [[opioids]], lithium and anesthetics and hence increase the potential for adverse effects such as [[respiratory depression]] and [[sedation]].

It is also a moderate inhibitor of [[CYP2D6]] and also a substrate for [[CYP2D6]] and hence can inhibit its own metabolism. It can also inhibit the clearance of [[CYP2D6]] substrates such as [[dextromethorphan]] and hence also potentiate their effects. Other drugs like [[codeine]] and [[tamoxifen]] which require [[CYP2D6]]-mediated activation into their respective active metabolites may have their therapeutic effects attenuated. Likewise [[CYP2D6]] inhibitors such as [[paroxetine]] or [[fluoxetine]] can reduce chlorpromazine clearance and hence increase serum levels of chlorpromazine and hence potentially also its adverse effects. Chlorpromazine also reduces [[phenytoin]] levels and increases [[valproic acid]] levels. It also reduces [[propranolol]] clearance and antagonizes the therapeutic effects of [[antidiabetic]] agents, [[levodopa]] (a [[Parkinson's]] medication. This is likely due to the fact that chlorpromazine antagonizes the D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor which is one of the receptors dopamine, a levodopa metabolite, activates), [[amphetamine]]s and [[anticoagulant]]s. It may also interact with anticholinergic drugs such as [[orphenadrine]] to produce [[hypoglycaemia]] (low blood sugar).

Chlorpromazine may also interact with [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline) to produce a paradoxical fall in blood pressure. [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitors]] (MAOIs) and [[thiazide]] diuretics may also accentuate the orthostatic hypotension experienced by those receiving chlorpromazine treatment. Quinidine may interact with chlorpromazine to increase [[myocardium|myocardial]]depression. Likewise it may also antagonize the effects of [[clonidine]] and [[guanethidine]]. It also may reduce the seizure threshold and hence a corresponding titration of anticonvulsant treatments should be considered. [[Prochlorperazine]] and [[desferrioxamine]] may also interact with chlorpromazine to produce transient metabolic [[encephalopathy]].

Other drugs that prolong the QT interval such as [[quinidine]], [[verapamil]], [[amiodarone]], [[sotalol]] and [[methadone]] may also interact with chlorpromazine to produce additive [[QT interval]] prolongation.

===Tolerance and withdrawal===
The [[British National Formulary]] recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotic treatment to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse.

A failure to notice withdrawal symptoms may be due to the relatively long half life of the drug resulting in the extremely slow excretion from the body. However, there are reports of muscular discomfort, exaggeration of psychotic symptoms and movement disorders, and difficulty sleeping when the antipsychotic drug is suddenly withdrawn, but after years of normal doses these effects are not normally seen.

    <title>Primidone</title>

Primidone can cause drowsiness, listlessness, [[ataxia]], visual disturbances, [[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]], headache, and dizziness. These side effects are the most common, occurring in more than 1% of users.

[[File:Morbus dupuytren fcm.jpg|thumb|right|Dupuytren's contracture of the fourth digit (ring finger).]]
[[Dupuytren's contracture]], a disease of the [[fascia]]e in the palm and fingers that permanently bends the fingers (usually the little and ring fingers) toward the palm, was first noted to be highly prevalent in epileptic people in 1941 by a Dr. Lund, fourteen years before primidone was on the market. Lund also noted that it was equally prevalent in individuals with idiopathic and symptomatic epilepsy and that the severity of the epilepsy did not matter. However, only one quarter of the women were affected vs. half of the men.

Primidone has other cardiovascular effects in beyond shortening the QT interval. Both it and phenobarbital are associated with elevated serum levels (both fasting and six hours after [[methionine]] loading) of [[homocysteine]], an [[amino acid]] derived from methionine. This is almost certainly related to the low folate levels reported in primidone users. Elevated levels of homocysteine have been linked to [[coronary heart disease]]. In 1985, both drugs were also reported to increase serum levels of [[high density lipoprotein]] (HDL) [[cholesterol]], total cholesterol, and [[apolipoprotein]]s A and B.

Less than 1% of primidone users will experience a rash. Compared to carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and phenytoin, this is very low. The rate is comparable to that of felbamate, vigabatrin, and topiramate.

[[File:XrayRicketsLegssmall.jpg|thumb|Radiograph of a rickets sufferer|right]]
Primidone, along with phenytoin and phenobarbital, is one of the anticonvulsants most heavily associated with bone diseases such as [[osteoporosis]], [[osteopenia]] (which can precede osteoporosis), [[osteomalacia]] and fractures. However, it has been suggested that bone demineralization is most pronounced in young people (25–44 years of age) and one 1987 study of institutionalized people found that the rate of osteomalacia in the ones taking anticonvulsants&amp;mdash;one out of nineteen individuals taking an anticonvulsant (vs. none among the thirty-seven people taking none) &amp;mdash;was similar to that expected in elderly people. The authors speculated that this was due to improvements in diet, sun exposure and exercise in response to earlier findings, and/or that this was because it was sunnier in London than in the Northern European countries which had earlier reported this effect. In any case, the use of more than one anticonvulsant has been associated with an increased prevalence of bone disease in institutionalized epilepsy patients versus institutionalized people who did not have epilepsy. Likewise, postmenopausal women taking anticonvulsants have a greater risk of fracture than their drug-naive counterparts.

Anticonvulsants affect the bones in many ways. They cause [[hypophosphatemia]], [[hypocalcemia]], low Vitamin D levels, and increased [[parathyroid hormone]]. Anticonvulsants also contribute to the increased rate of fractures by causing somnolence, ataxia, and tremor which would cause gait disturbance, further increasing the risk of fractures on top of the increase due to seizures and the restrictions on activity placed on epileptic people.Increased fracture rate has also been reported for carbamazepine, valproate and clonazepam. The risk of fractures is higher for people taking enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants than for people taking non-enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants. In addition to all of the above, primidone can cause [[arthralgia]].

[[Granulocytopenia]], [[agranulocytosis]], and [[red-cell hypoplasia]] and aplasia, and megaloblastic anemia are rarely associated with the use of primidone.

In addition to increasing the risk of megaloblastic anemia, primidone, like other older anticonvulsants also increases the risk of [[neural tube defect]]s, but there is conflicting evidence regarding the effectiveness of vitamin supplementation in the prevention of such defects. Because of this, primidone is a Category D medication.

In May 2005, Dr. M. Lopez-Gomez's team reported an association between the use of primidone and [[depression (mood)|depression]] in epilepsy patients; this same study reported that inadequate seizure control, posttraumatic epilepsy, and polytherapy were also risk factors. Polytherapy was also associated with poor seizure control. Out of all of the risk factors, usage of primidone and inadequate seizure control were the greatest; with [[odds ratio|OR]]s of 4.089 and 3.084, respectively. They had been looking for factors associated with depression in epilepsy patients. Schaffer et al. 1999 reported that one of their treatment failures, a 45-year-old woman taking 50&amp;nbsp;mg a day along with lithium 600&amp;nbsp;mg/day, [[clozapine]] 12.5&amp;nbsp;mg/day, [[trazodone]] 50&amp;nbsp;mg/day, and alprazolam 4&amp;nbsp;mg/day for three and a half months experienced auditory hallucinations that led to discontinuation of primidone. It can also cause [[hyperactivity]] in children; Like phenytoin, primidone is rarely associated with lymphadenopathy.

===Overdose===
The most common symptoms of primidone overdose are coma with loss of [[deep tendon reflex]]es and, during the recovery period, if the patient survives, disorientation, [[dysarthria]], nystagmus, and ataxia, The symptoms of primidone poisoning have generally been attributed to its biotransformation to phenobarbital; however, primidone has toxic effects independent of its metabolites in humans. The massive [[crystalluria]] that sometimes occurs sets its symptom profile apart from that of phenobarbital. needle-like, shimmering, hexagonal plates consisting mainly of primidone.

In the Netherlands alone, there were thirty-four cases of suspected primidone poisoning between 1978 and 1982. Out of these, Primidone poisoning was much less common than phenobarbital poisoning. Twenty-seven of those adult cases were reported to the Dutch National Poison Control Center. Out of these, one person taking it with phenytoin and phenobarbital died, twelve became drowsy and four were comatose.

Treatments for primidone overdose have included [[hemoperfusion]] with [[forced diuresis]], a combination of [[bemegride]] and [[amiphenazole]]; and a combination of bemegride, [[spironolactone]], caffeine, [[metrazol|pentylenetetrazol]], strophanthin, penicillin and [[streptomycin]].

In the three adults who are reported to have succumbed, the doses were 20–30 g. However, two adult survivors ingested 30 g 25 g, and 22.5 g. One woman experienced symptoms of primidone intoxication after ingesting 750&amp;nbsp;mg of her roommate's primidone.

The most common side effect is [[akathisia]]. Levomepromazine has prominent [[sedative]] and [[anticholinergic]]/[[sympatholytic]] effects (dry mouth, [[hypotension]], [[sinus tachycardia]], night sweats) and may cause weight gain. These side effects normally preclude prescribing the drug in doses needed for full [[remission (medicine)|remission]] of schizophrenia, so it has to be combined with a more potent antipsychotic. In any case, blood pressure and [[EKG]] should be monitored regularly.

A rare but life-threatening side effect is [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]] (NMS). The symptoms of NMS include muscle stiffness, convulsions and fever.

Common side effects include headache, diarrhea, nausea, flatulence, decreased appetite, constipation, dry mouth, and abdominal pain. More severe side effects are severe allergic reactions, chest pain, dark urine, fast heartbeat, fever, paresthesia, persistent sore throat, severe stomach pain, unusual bruising or bleeding, unusual tiredness, and yellowing of the eyes or skin.

Proton pump inhibitors may be associated with a greater risk of hip fractures and ''[[Clostridium difficile colitis|Clostridium difficile]]''-associated diarrhoea.  Patients are frequently administered the drugs in intensive care as a protective measure against ulcers, but this use is also associated with a 30% increase in occurrence of [[pneumonia]].

Adverse effects by frequency include: [[Neutropenia]] tends to peak about 9–14 days after beginning treatment. [[Thrombocytopenia]] tends to peak about 7–17 days after the beginning of treatment and tends to recover about 10 days after its peak. [[Cardiotoxicity]] is a fairly common side effect, but usually this cardiotoxicity is just [[angina]] or symptoms associated with [[Coronary vasospasm|coronary artery spasm]], but in about 0.55% of those receiving the drug will develop life-threatening cardiotoxicity.

Loteprednol is also far less likely to cause elevated IOP compared to [[dexamethasone]].{{fact|date=October 2016}}

{{See also|List of adverse effects of paroxetine}}

Paroxetine shares many of the common adverse effects of SSRIs, including (with the corresponding rates seen in people treated with placebo in parentheses): nausea 26% (9%), diarrhea 12% (8%), constipation 14% (9%), dry mouth 18% (12%), somnolence 23% (9%), insomnia 13% (6%), headache 18% (17%), [[hypomania]] 1% (0.3%), blurred vision 4%(1%), loss of appetite 6% (2%), nervousness 5% (3%), [[paraesthesia]] 4% (2%), dizziness 13% (6%), asthenia (weakness; 15% (6%)), tremor 8% (2%), sweating 11% (2%), and sexual dysfunction (≥10% incidence). Most of these adverse effects are transient and go away with continued treatment. Central and peripheral [[5-HT3 receptor|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]] stimulation is believed to result in the gastrointestinal effects observed with SSRI treatment. Compared to other SSRIs, it has a lower incidence of diarrhea, a higher incidence of anticholinergic effects (e.g., dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, etc.), sedation/somnolence/drowsiness, sexual side effects, and weight gain.

Due to reports of adverse withdrawal reactions upon terminating treatment, the [[Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use]] (CHMP) at the [[European Medicines Agency]] recommends gradually reducing over several weeks or months if the decision to withdraw is made. See also [[Paroxetine#Discontinuation syndrome|Discontinuation syndrome (withdrawal)]].

[[Mania]] or [[hypomania]] may occur in 1% of patients with depression and up to 12% of patients with [[bipolar disorder]]. This side effect can occur in individuals with no history of mania but it may be more likely to occur in those with bipolar or with a family history of mania.

===Suicide===
Like other antidepressants, paroxetine may increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behaviour in children and adolescents. The [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] conducted a statistical analysis of paroxetine clinical trials in children and adolescents in 2004 and found an increase in suicidality and ideation as compared to placebo, which was observed in trials for both depression and anxiety disorders. According to the prescribing information, &quot;epidemiological studies have shown that infants born to women who had first trimester paroxetine exposure had an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations, primarily ventricular and atrial septal defects (VSDs and ASDs). In general, septal defects range from those that are symptomatic and may require surgery to those that are asymptomatic and may resolve spontaneously. If a patient becomes pregnant while taking paroxetine, she should be advised of the potential harm to the fetus. Unless the benefits of paroxetine to the mother justify continuing treatment, consideration should be given to either discontinuing paroxetine therapy or switching to another antidepressant.&quot; These conclusions are supported by multiple [[systematic review]]s and meta-analyses that found that, on average, the use of paroxetine during pregnancy is associated with about 1.5–1.7-fold increase in congenital birth defects, in particular, heart defects.

===Discontinuation syndrome===
{{See also|SSRI discontinuation syndrome}}
Many psychoactive medications can cause withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation from administration. Evidence has shown that paroxetine has among the highest incidence rates and severity of withdrawal syndrome of any medication of its class.{{mcn|date=October 2015}} Common withdrawal symptoms for paroxetine include nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness and vertigo; insomnia, nightmares and vivid dreams; feelings of electricity in the body, as well as crying and anxiety.{{mcn|date=October 2015}} Liquid formulation of paroxetine is available and allows a very gradual decrease of the dose, which may prevent discontinuation syndrome. Another recommendation is to temporarily switch to [[fluoxetine]], which has a longer [[half-life]] and thus decreases the severity of discontinuation syndrome.{{Unreliable medical source|date=January 2017}}

Infrequent adverse effects include esophageal ulceration, [[Congestive heart failure|heart failure]], [[hyperkalemia]], [[Renal failure|renal impairment]], confusion, and [[bronchospasm]]. Ibuprofen can exacerbate asthma, sometimes fatally.

===Interactions===
Drinking alcohol when taking ibuprofen may increase the risk of stomach bleeding. Since ibuprofen has acidic properties and is also excreted in the urine, [[forced diuresis|forced alkaline diuresis]] is theoretically beneficial. However, because ibuprofen is highly protein-bound in the blood, renal excretion of unchanged drug is minimal. Forced alkaline diuresis is, therefore, of limited benefit. Symptomatic therapy for hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding, acidosis, and renal toxicity may be indicated. On occasion, close monitoring in an [[intensive-care unit]] for several days is necessary. A patient who survives the acute intoxication usually experiences no late [[sequelae]].

===Miscarriage===
A study of pregnant women suggests those taking any type or amount of NSAIDs (including ibuprofen, [[diclofenac]] and [[naproxen]]) were 2.4 times more likely to [[miscarriage|miscarry]] than those not taking the drugs. However, an Israeli study found no increased risk of miscarriage in the group of mothers using NSAIDs.

    <title>Warfarin</title>


===Bleeding===
The only common [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]] of warfarin is [[hemorrhage|bleeding]]. The risk of severe bleeding is small but definite (a typically yearly rate of 1-3% has been reported) and any benefit needs to outweigh this risk when warfarin is considered. All types of bleeding occur more commonly, but the most severe ones are those involving the brain (intracerebral hemorrhage/hemorrhagic stroke) and the [[spinal cord]]. Risk of bleeding is increased if the INR is out of range (due to accidental or deliberate overdose or due to interactions). This risk increases greatly once the INR exceeds 4.5.

A number of risk scores exist to predict bleeding in people using warfarin and similar anticoagulants. A commonly used score ([[HAS-BLED]]) includes known predictors of warfarin-related bleeding: uncontrolled high blood pressure (H), abnormal [[renal function|kidney function]] (A), previous stroke (S), known previous bleeding condition (B), previous labile INR when on anticoagulation (L), elderly as defined by age over 65 (E), and drugs associated with bleeding (e.g. aspirin) or alcohol misuse (D). While their use is recommended in clinical practice guidelines, they are only moderately effective in predicting bleeding risk and do not perform well in predicting hemorrhagic stroke. Bleeding risk may be increased in people on [[hemodialysis]]. Another score used to assess bleeding risk on anticoagulation, specifically Warfarin or Coumadin, is the ATRIA score, which uses a weighted additive scale of clinical findings to determine bleeding risk stratification. The risks of bleeding are increased further when warfarin is combined with [[antiplatelet drug]]s such as [[clopidogrel]], [[aspirin]], or [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s.

===Warfarin necrosis===
{{Main article|warfarin necrosis}}
A rare but serious complication resulting from treatment with warfarin is [[warfarin necrosis]], which occurs more frequently shortly after commencing treatment in patients with a deficiency of [[protein C]]. Protein C is an innate anticoagulant that, like the procoagulant factors that warfarin inhibits, requires vitamin K-dependent carboxylation for its activity. Since warfarin initially decreases protein C levels faster than the coagulation factors, it can paradoxically increase the blood's tendency to coagulate when treatment is first begun (many patients when starting on warfarin are given [[heparin]] in parallel to combat this), leading to massive thrombosis with skin [[necrosis]] and [[gangrene]] of limbs. Its natural counterpart, [[purpura fulminans]], occurs in children who are [[homozygous]] for certain protein C mutations.

===Osteoporosis===
After initial reports that warfarin could reduce [[bone mineral density]], several studies have demonstrated a link between warfarin use and [[osteoporosis]]-related [[bone fracture|fracture]]. A 1999 study in 572 women taking warfarin for [[Deep vein thrombosis|deep venous thrombosis]], risk of [[Vertebral compression fracture|vertebral fracture]] and [[rib fracture]] was increased; other fracture types did not occur more commonly. A 2002 study looking at a randomly selected selection of 1523 patients with osteoporotic fracture found no increased exposure to anticoagulants compared to controls, and neither did stratification of the duration of anticoagulation reveal a trend towards fracture.

A 2006 retrospective study of 14,564 Medicare recipients showed that warfarin use for more than one year was linked with a 60% increased risk of osteoporosis-related fracture in men; there was no association in women. The mechanism was thought to be a combination of reduced intake of vitamin K, which is necessary for bone health, and inhibition by warfarin of vitamin K-mediated carboxylation of certain bone proteins, rendering them nonfunctional.

===Purple toe syndrome===
Another rare complication that may occur early during warfarin treatment (usually within 3 to 8 weeks of commencement) is ''[[cholesterol embolism|purple toe syndrome]]''. This condition is thought to result from small deposits of [[cholesterol]] breaking loose and causing embolisms in blood vessels in the skin of the feet, which causes a blueish purple colour and may be painful.

It is typically thought to affect the big toe, but it affects other parts of the feet as well, including the bottom of the foot (plantar surface). The occurrence of purple toe syndrome may require discontinuation of warfarin.

===Calcification===
Several studies have also implicated warfarin use in valvular and vascular calcification. No specific treatment is available, but some modalities are under investigation.

    <title>Insulin degludec</title>

A significant side effect of insulin therapy is hypoglycemia.  A meta-analysis of clinical trials published in July 2012 found 39 to 47.9 events of hypoglycemia (defined as blood glucose &lt;56&amp;nbsp;mg/dL) per patient year, with higher rates in the more concentrated degludec formulation.  Rates of nocturnal hypoglycemia ranged from 3.7 to 5.1 events per patient year.

    <title>Mitoxantrone</title>

Mitoxantrone, as with other drugs in its class,  may cause [[adverse drug reaction|adverse reactions]] of varying severity, including [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[hair loss]], heart damage and [[immunosuppression]], possibly with delayed onset. [[Cardiomyopathy]] is a particularly concerning effect as it is irreversible; thus regular monitoring with [[echocardiogram]]s or [[MUGA scan]]s is recommended for patients.

Because of the risk of cardiomyopathy, mitoxantrone carries a limit on the cumulative lifetime dose (based on body surface area) in MS patients.

    <title>Degarelix</title>

As with all hormonal therapies, degarelix is commonly associated with hormonal side effects such as [[hot flashes]] and [[weight gain]]. Due to its mode of administration ([[subcutaneous injection]]), degarelix is also associated with injection-site reactions such as injection-site pain, [[erythema]] or swelling. Injection-site reactions are usually mild or moderate in intensity and occur predominantly after the first dose, decreasing in frequency thereafter.

Since glycopyrronium reduces the body's sweating ability, it can even cause [[hyperthermia]] and [[heat stroke]] in hot environments. Dry mouth, difficulty urinating, [[headache]]s, [[diarrhea]] and [[constipation]] are also observed side effects of the medication. The medication also induces [[drowsiness]] or blurred vision, an effect exacerbated by the consumption of [[alcohol]].

The most common adverse effects observed in clinical trials were [[upper respiratory tract infection]]s (more than 10% of patients), [[nasopharyngitis]] (common cold), headache, and high blood pressure (at least 5%). The enzyme [[alanine transaminase]] was also elevated in at least 5% of patients, but in most cases without symptoms. Elevated total cholesterol levels were common.  Among the less common side effects were dizziness, various infections, as well as reactions of the skin and [[mucosae]] like mild rashes, [[gastritis]] and [[mouth ulcer]]. Rare but severe reactions were [[gastrointestinal perforation]]s (0.26% in six months) and [[anaphylaxis]] (0.2%).

    <title>Fludarabine</title>

Fludarabine is associated with profound [[lymphopenia]], and as a consequence, increases the risk of [[opportunistic infection]]s. People who have been treated with fludarabine will usually be asked to take [[co-trimoxazole]] or to use monthly nebulised [[pentamidine]] to prevent [[Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia|''Pneumocystis jiroveci'' pneumonia]].  The profound lymphopenia caused by fludarabine renders patients susceptible to [[transfusion-associated graft versus host disease]], an oftentimes fatal complication of [[blood transfusion]].  For this reason, all patients who have ever received fludarabine should only be given [[irradiation|irradiated]] blood components.

Fludarabine causes anemia, thrombocytopenia and [[neutropenia]], requiring regular blood count monitoring.  Some patients require blood and [[platelet]] transfusion, or [[granulocyte colony-stimulating factor|G-CSF]] injections to boost [[neutrophil]] counts.

Fludarabine is associated with the development of severe [[autoimmune hemolytic anemia]] in a proportion of patients.

Difficulties are often encountered when harvesting peripheral blood stem cells from patients previously treated with fludarabine.

    <title>Vancomycin</title>

Serum vancomycin levels may be monitored in an effort to reduce side effects, although the value of such monitoring has been questioned. Peak and trough levels are usually monitored, and for research purposes, the area under the concentration curve is also sometimes used. Toxicity is best monitored by looking at trough values.

Common [[adverse drug reaction]]s (≥1% of patients) associated with IV vancomycin include: local pain, which may be severe, and [[thrombophlebitis]].

Damage to the kidneys and to the hearing were a side effect of the early impure versions of vancomycin, and these were prominent in the clinical trials conducted in the mid-1950s. Later trials using purer forms of vancomycin found [[nephrotoxicity]] is an infrequent adverse effect (0.1% to 1% of patients), but this is accentuated in the presence of [[aminoglycoside]]s.

Rare adverse effects (&lt;0.1% of patients) include: [[anaphylaxis]], [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]], [[erythema multiforme]], [[Vancomycin#Red man syndrome|red man syndrome]], [[superinfection]], [[thrombocytopenia]], [[neutropenia]], [[leukopenia]], [[tinnitus]], [[Vancomycin#Ototoxicity|dizziness and/or ototoxicity]], and [[Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms|DRESS syndrome]].

Vancomycin can induce platelet-reactive antibodies in the patient, leading to severe [[thrombocytopenia]] and bleeding with florid [[Petechia|petechial hemorrhages]], [[ecchymoses]], and wet [[purpura]].

Vancomycin has traditionally been considered a nephrotoxic and ototoxic drug, based on observations by early investigators of elevated serum levels in renally impaired patients who had experienced ototoxicity, and subsequently through case reports in the medical literature. However, as the use of vancomycin increased with the spread of MRSA beginning in the 1970s, the previously reported rates of toxicity were recognized as not being observed. This was attributed to the removal of the impurities present in the earlier formulation of the drug, although those impurities were not specifically tested for toxicity.

===Nephrotoxicity===
Subsequent reviews of accumulated case reports of vancomycin-related nephrotoxicity found  many of the patients had also received other known nephrotoxins, in particular, [[aminoglycosides]]. Most of the rest had other confounding factors, or insufficient data regarding the possibility of such, that prohibited the clear association of vancomycin with the observed renal dysfunction.

In 1994, the use of vancomycin monotherapy was clearly documented in only three of 82 available cases in the literature. Prospective and retrospective studies attempting to evaluate the incidence of vancomycin-related nephrotoxicity have largely been methodologically flawed and have produced variable results. The most methodologically sound investigations indicate  the actual incidence of vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity is around 5% to 7%. To put this into context, similar rates of renal dysfunction have been reported for [[cefamandole]] and [[benzylpenicillin]], two reputedly non-nephrotoxic antibiotics.

In addition, evidence to relate nephrotoxicity to vancomycin serum levels is inconsistent. Some studies have indicated an increased rate of nephrotoxicity when trough levels exceed 10&amp;nbsp;µg/ml, but others have not reproduced these results. Nephrotoxicity has also been observed with concentrations within the &quot;therapeutic&quot; range, as well. In essence, the reputation of vancomycin as a nephrotoxin is overstated, and it has not been demonstrated that maintaining vancomycin serum levels within certain ranges will prevent its nephrotoxic effects, when they do occur.

===Ototoxicity===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Vancomycin]] (this page)--&gt;
Attempts to establish rates of vancomycin-induced ototoxicity are even more difficult due to the scarcity of quality evidence. The current consensus is that clearly related cases of vancomycin ototoxicity are rare. The association between vancomycin serum levels and ototoxicity is also uncertain. While cases of ototoxicity have been reported in patients whose vancomycin serum level exceeded 80&amp;nbsp;µg/ml, cases have been reported in patients with therapeutic levels, as well. Thus, whether [[therapeutic drug monitoring]] of vancomycin for the purpose of maintaining &quot;therapeutic&quot; levels will prevent ototoxicity also remains unproven.

===Interactions with other nephrotoxins===
Another area of controversy and uncertainty concerns the question of whether, and if so, to what extent, vancomycin increases the toxicity of other nephrotoxins. Clinical studies have yielded variable results, but animal models indicate some increased nephrotoxic effect probably occurs when vancomycin is added to nephrotoxins such as aminoglycosides. However, a dose- or serum level-effect relationship has not been established.

Data from clinical trials submitted to regulatory authorities showed that rimonabant caused depressive disorders or mood alterations in up to 10% of subjects and suicidal ideation in around 1%, and in Europe it was contraindicated for people with any psychiatric disorder, including depressed or suicidal individuals.

Additionally, nausea and upper respiratory tract infections were very common (occurring in more than 10% of people) adverse effects; common adverse effects (occurring in between 1% and 10% of people) included [[gastroenteritis]], anxiety, irritability, insomnia and other sleep disorders, hot flushes, diarrhea, vomiting, dry or itchy skin, tendonitis, muscle cramps and spasms, fatigue, flu-like symptoms, and increased risk of falling.

The FDA's advisory committee raised concerns that based on animal data, it appeared that the [[therapeutic window]] with regard to CNS toxicity, and specifically seizures was almost nonexistent; the therapeutic dose and the dose that caused seizures in animals appeared to be the same.

When the EMA reviewed [[postmarketing surveillance]] data, it found that the risk of psychiatric disorders in people taking rimonabant was doubled.

The chemical structure of cefmetazole, like that of several other cephalosporins, contains an ''N''-methylthiotetrazole (NMTT or 1-MTT) [[side chain]]. As the antibiotic is broken down in the body, it releases free NMTT, which can cause [[hypoprothrombinemia]] (likely due to [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibition]] of the [[enzyme]] [[vitamin K epoxide reductase]]) and a reaction with ethanol similar to that produced by [[disulfiram]], due to inhibition of [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]].

    <title>Methylprednisolone</title>

{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
Long-term use of methylprednisolone, as with all corticosteroids, can be associated with [[hyperglycemia]], decreased resistance to infection, swelling of face, weight gain, congestive cardiac insufficiency, fluid and sodium retention, [[edema]], [[hypertension]], increased eye pressure, [[glaucoma]], [[osteoporosis]], and [[psychosis]], especially when used at high doses. The most serious side effect occurs after the adrenal glands cease natural production of [[cortisol]], which methylprednisolone will replace. Abrupt cessation of the drug after this occurs can result in a condition known as [[Addison's disease#Addisonian crisis|Addisonian crisis]], which can be fatal. To prevent this, the drug is usually prescribed with a tapering dose, including a predosed &quot;dose pack&quot; detailing a specific number of tablets to take at designated times over a several-day period. Pharmacists sometimes advise that this drug may cause sleeplessness and &quot;down&quot; moods.

Individuals on methylprednisolone therapy should assiduously avoid exposure to measles and chicken pox, as contracting these viral infections while on high-dose corticosteroids can result in a potentially fatal viral course. Any accidental exposure to these viral infections by individuals uncertain of their immunity to chicken pox or measles should be reported immediately, as prophylactic immunoglobulin therapy may be administered. Additionally, the administration of live, attenuated vaccines is contraindicated for individuals taking immunosuppressive doses of methylprednisolone. The exception to this rule is patients receiving complete corticosteroid replacement therapy, e.g., for [[Addison's disease]], who may follow standard immunization protocols.

    <title>Anastrozole</title>

Bone weakness has been associated with anastrozole. Women who switched to anastrozole after two years on tamoxifen reported twice as many fractures as those who continued to take tamoxifen (2.1% compared to 1%). [[Bisphosphonates]] are sometimes prescribed to prevent the osteoporosis induced by aromatase inhibitors. The level of circulating estradiol is likely causal here and not the anastrozole itself, and so the dose will determine likelihood of osteoporosis (estradiol inhibits [[osteoclast]]s, which resorb bone). Acne, constricted pupils and water retention have also been attributed with use of this anti-estrogen.

    <title>Phenytoin</title>

Common side effects include nausea, stomach pain, loss of appetite, poor coordination, [[hypertrichosis|increased hair growth]], and enlargement of the gums.&lt;!--  --&gt; Potentially serious side effects include [[sleepiness]], [[self harm]], liver problems, [[bone marrow suppression]], [[hypotension|low blood pressure]], and [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]].&lt;!--  --&gt; There is evidence that use during pregnancy results in abnormalities in the baby.&lt;!--  --&gt; It appears to be okay during [[breastfeeding]].&lt;!--  --&gt; [[Ethanol|Alcohol]] may interfere with the medication's effects.

===Heart and blood vessels===
Severe [[hypotension|low blood pressure]] and abnormal heart rhythms can be seen with rapid infusion of IV phenytoin. IV infusion should not exceed 50&amp;nbsp;mg/min in adults or 1–3&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/min (or 50&amp;nbsp;mg/min, whichever is slower) in children. Heart monitoring should occur during and after IV infusion. Due to these risks, oral phenytoin should be used if possible.

===Neurological===
At therapeutic doses, phenytoin may produce [[nystagmus]] on lateral gaze. At toxic doses, patients experience vertical nystagmus, [[diplopia|double vision]], [[sedation]], slurred speech, cerebellar [[ataxia]], and [[tremor]]. If phenytoin is stopped abruptly, this may result in increased seizure frequency, including [[status epilepticus]].

Phenytoin may accumulate in the [[cerebral cortex]] over long periods of time which can cause [[atrophy]] of the [[cerebellum]]. The degree of atrophy is related to the duration of phenytoin treatment and is not related to dosage of the medication.

Abrupt discontinuation of phenytoin can precipitate [[status epilepticus]].

Phenytoin is known to be a causal factor in the development of [[peripheral neuropathy]].

===Blood===
It has been suggested that phenytoin causes a reduction in [[folic acid]] levels, predisposing patients to [[megaloblastic anemia]]. Folate is presented in foods as polyglutamate, which is then converted into monoglutamates by [[Gamma-glutamyl hydrolase|intestinal conjugase]]. Phenytoin acts by inhibiting this enzyme, thereby causing [[folate deficiency]].
Other side effects may include: [[agranulocytosis]], [[aplastic anemia]], [[leukopenia|decreased white blood cell count]], and [[thrombocytopenia|a low platelet count]].

===Pregnancy ===
Phenytoin is a known [[teratogenesis|teratogen]]. The syndrome consists of craniofacial anomalies (broad nasal bridge, cleft lip and palate, [[Microcephaly|smaller than normal head]]) and a mild form of mental retardation (average IQ=71). This syndrome resembles the well-described [[Fetal Alcohol Syndrome]] and has also been called the &quot;[[fetal hydantoin syndrome]]&quot;. Some recommend avoiding polytherapy and maintaining the minimal dose possible during pregnancy, but acknowledge that current data do not provide clear answers. Data now being collected by the Epilepsy and Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry may one day answer this question definitively.

===Cancer===
There is no good evidence that phenytoin is a human [[carcinogen]].

===Bones===
Chronic phenytoin use has been associated with decreased bone density and increased bone fractures. Phenytoin induces metabolizing enzymes in the liver. This leads to increased metabolism of [[vitamin D]], thus decreased vitamin D levels. [[Vitamin D deficiency]], as well as [[Hypocalcemia|low calcium]] and [[Hypophosphatemia|phosphate]] in the blood cause decreased bone mineral density.

Very common (greater than 10% of people experience them) adverse effects include loss of appetite. nausea, and vomiting.  Other side effects of unknown frequency include [[leucopenia|reduction in leukocytes]], [[thrombocytopenia|reduction in platelets]], [[Neutropenia|reduction in neutrophils]], which can lead to increased infections including lung infections; severe allergy-like reactions that can lead to [[angioedema]] and skin reactions; lethargy; liver complications including [[jaundice]] and abnormal liver function tests; reproductive effects including [[Azoospermia|reduction in sperm count]] and [[ovarian failure]].

When combined with [[ethanol]], procarbazine may cause a [[disulfiram]]-like reaction in some people.

It weakly inhibits MAO in the gastrointestinal system, so it can cause hypertensive crises if associated with the ingestion of tyramine-rich foods such as aged cheeses; this appears to be rare.

Procarbazine rarely causes [[chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy]], a progressive, enduring, often irreversible tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes involving the arms and legs.

Adverse effects include [[gastrointestinal problem]]s such as constipation, as well as vitamin and [[calcium]] deficiency. Vitamin K deficiency sometimes causes gastrointestinal bleeding.

    <title>Mefloquine</title>

Mefloquine is contraindicated in those with a previous history of [[seizures]] or a recent history of [[psychiatric disorders]]. Severe side effects requiring hospitalization are rare. Compared to other malaria prophylaxis regimens, mefloqinone may produce more side effects in non-pregnant travelers.  In pregnant travelers, it appears to pose minimal risk to the fetus.

 
===Neurologic and psychiatric===
In 2013 the [[United States Food and Drug Administration]] added a [[boxed warning]] to the U.S. label of mefloquine regarding the potential for neuropsychiatric side effects that may persist even after discontinuing administration of the drug.  Psychiatric effects include nightmares, visual and auditory hallucinations, anxiety, depression, unusual behavior, and suicidal ideations, among others.  Neurologic effects include dizziness, loss of balance, and tinnitus.  The label warns that mild symptoms may presage more serious ones, and that the drug should be discontinued at the first sign of symptoms.  Mefloquine should not be used in people with a history of psychiatric problems.

Central nervous system events requiring hospitalization occur in about one in 10,000 people taking mefloquine for malaria prevention, with milder events (e.g., dizziness, headache, insomnia, and vivid dreams) in up to 25%. When some measure of subjective severity is applied to the rating of adverse events, about 11-17% of travelers are incapacitated to some degree.

===Cardiac===
Mefloquine may cause abnormalities with heart rhythms that are visible on [[electrocardiogram]]s.  Combining mefloquine with other drugs that cause similar effects, such as quinine or [[quinidine]], can increase these effects.  Combining mefloquine with halofantrine can cause significant increases in [[QTc interval]]s.{{rp|10}}

Up to 20% of people taking isoniazid experience [[peripheral neuropathy]] when taking doses of 6&amp;nbsp;mg/kg of weight daily or higher. Gastrointestinal reactions include nausea and vomiting. Hypersensitivity reactions are also common and can present with a [[maculopapular]] rash and fever.

Asymptomatic elevation of serum liver enzyme concentrations occurs in 10% to 20% of people taking INH, and liver enzyme concentrations usually return to normal even when treatment is continued. Symptoms suggestive of liver toxicity include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, right upper quadrant pain, and loss of appetite. Black and Hispanic women are at higher risk for isoniazid-induced hepatotoxicity. When it happens, isoniazid-induced liver toxicity has been shown to occur in 50% of patients within the first 2 months of therapy.

Some recommend that liver function should be monitored carefully in all people receiving it, but others recommend monitoring only in certain populations.

Headache, poor concentration, weight gain, poor memory, insomnia, and depression have all been associated with isoniazid use. All patients and healthcare workers should be aware of these serious side effects, especially if suicidal ideation or behavior are suspected.

A very rare side effect of prazosin is [[priapism]].

Orthostatic hypotension and syncope are associated with the body's poor ability to control blood pressure without active alpha-adrenergic receptors. Patients on prazosin should be told to rise to stand up slowly, since their poor baroreflex may cause them to faint if their blood pressure is not adequately maintained during standing. The nasal congestion is due to dilation of vessels in the nasal [[mucosa]].

    <title>Zuclopenthixol</title>

Chronic administration of zuclopenthixol (30&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day for two years) in rats resulted in small, but significant, increases in the incidence of thyroid parafollicular carcinomas and, in females, of mammary adenocarcinomas and of pancreatic islet cell adenomas and carcinomas. An increase in the incidence of mammary adenocarcinomas is a common finding for D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; antagonists which increase prolactin secretion when administered to rats. An increase in the incidence of pancreatic islet cell tumours has been observed for some other D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; antagonists. The physiological differences between rats and humans with regard to prolactin make the clinical significance of these findings unclear.

Other permanent side effects are similar to many other typical antipsychotics, namely [[extrapyramidal symptoms]] as a result of dopamine blockade in subcortical areas of the brain. This may result in symptoms similar to those seen in [[Parkinson's disease]] and include a restlessness and inability to sit still known as [[akathisia]], a slow tremor and stiffness of the limbs. Zuclopenthixol is thought to be more sedating than the related [[flupentixol]], though possibly less likely to induce extrapyramidal symptoms than other typical depots. As with other dopamine antagonists, zuclopenthixol may sometimes elevate [[prolactin]] levels; this may occasionally result in [[amenorrhoea]] or [[galactorrhoea]] in severe cases. [[Neuroleptic malignant syndrome]] is a rare but potentially fatal side effect. Any unexpected deterioration in mental state with confusion and muscle stiffness should be seen by a physician.

Zuclopenthixol decanoate induces a transient dose-dependent sedation. However, if the patient is switched to maintenance treatment with zuclopenthixol decanoate from oral zuclopenthixol or from i.m. zuclopenthixol acetate the sedation will be no problem. Tolerance to the unspecific sedative effect develops rapidly.

    <title>Cefazolin</title>

[[Adverse drug reaction|Side effect]]s associated with use of cefazolin therapy include:
* Common (1-10%): diarrhea, stomach pain or upset stomach, vomiting, and rash. 
* Uncommon (&lt;1%): dizziness, headache, fatigue, itching, transient hepatitis.
Patients with penicillin allergies could experience a potential reaction to cefazolin and other cephalosporins. As with other antibiotics, patients experiencing watery and/or bloody stools occurring up to three months following therapy should contact their prescriber.

Like those of several other cephalosporins, the chemical structure of cefazolin contains an [[N-methylthiodiazole]] (NMTD or 1-MTD) side-chain. As the antibiotic is broken down in the body, it releases free NMTD, which can cause [[hypoprothrombinemia]] (likely due to inhibition of the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase) and a reaction with ethanol similar to that produced by disulfiram (Antabuse), due to inhibition of [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]]. Those with an allergy to [[side effects of penicillin|penicillin]] may develop a cross sensitivity to cefazolin.

    <title>Nisoxetine</title>

Norepinephrine, along with dopamine and/or other serotonin reuptake inhibitors, are often prescribed in the treatment of mood disorders and are generally well tolerated.

Preclinical studies in humans using nisoxetine were conducted in the 1970s, and side effects of the drug were examined. Doses ranging from 1&amp;nbsp;mg to 50&amp;nbsp;mg do not result in any changes in base line values in haematologic tests, routine blood chemistries, or coagulation parameters. Larger doses produce some side effects, but no electrocardiographic changes are observed in any doses. Injections with doses of tyramine in humans while receiving nisoxetine results in a decreased responsiveness to tyramine with increased duration of administered nisoxetine. Another effect of nisoxetine administration is that subjects require much smaller doses of norepinephrine to produce the same blood pressure responses as those who receive a placebo. In other words, subjects exhibit an increased sensitivity to norepinephrine after nisoxetine administration. Preclinical test conclude that the drug, in tested doses, appears to be safe for use in humans.

Pheniramine may cause drowsiness or [[bradycardia]], and over-dosage may lead to sleep disorders.

Overdose may lead to [[seizures]], especially in combination with alcohol.

People combining with [[cortisol]] in the long term should avoid pheniramine as it may decrease levels of adrenaline (epinephrine) which may lead to loss of consciousness.

Pheniramine is a [[deliriant]] (hallucinogen) in toxic doses. Recreational use of Robitussin for the [[dissociative]] (hallucinogenic) effect of its dextromethorphan is hazardous because it also contains chlorpheniramine.

Its most common side effects are digestive (mostly [[dyspepsia]], [[stomatitis|mouth swelling]], nausea, vomiting and taste disturbance), vasomotor (mostly flushing, fainting, dizziness, sweating, weakness, palpitations, [[dyspnoea|shortness of breath]] and blurred vision) or dermatologic (usually itchiness, rash, local irritation near to the injection site and hair loss) in nature, although [[conjunctivitis]], blood dyscrasias, kidney damage, [[arthralgia|joint pain]], [[myalgia|muscle aches/pains]] and liver dysfunction are also common. Rarely it can cause: [[aplastic anaemia]], ulcerative enterocolitis, [[dysphagia|difficulty swallowing]], [[angiooedema]], [[pneumonitis]], [[pulmonary fibrosis]], hepatotoxicity, [[cholestatic jaundice]], [[peripheral neuropathy]], [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]], [[encephalopathy]], [[encephalitis]] and [[photosensitivity]].

    <title>Clofarabine</title>

* [[Tumor lysis syndrome]] (TLS). Clofarabine quickly kills leukaemia cells in the blood. The body may react to this. Signs include hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, and hyperphosphatemia.  TLS is very serious and can lead to death if it is not treated right away.
* Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS): symptoms include fast breathing, fast heartbeat, low blood pressure, and fluid in the lungs. 
*Bone marrow problems (suppression). Clofarabine can stop the bone marrow from making enough [[red blood cells]], [[white blood cells]], and [[platelets]]. Serious side effects that can happen because of bone marrow suppression include severe infection ([[sepsis]]), bleeding, and [[anemia]].
*Effects on [[pregnancy]] and [[breastfeeding]]. Girls and women should not become pregnant or breastfeed during treatment which may harm the baby.
*[[Dehydration]] and [[low blood pressure]]. Clofarabine can cause [[vomiting]] and [[diarrhea]] which may lead to low body fluid (dehydration). Signs and symptoms of dehydration include dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting spells, or decreased [[urination]].
*Other side effects. The most common side effects are stomach problems (including vomiting, diarrhea, and [[nausea]]), and effects on blood cells (including low red blood cells count, low white blood cell count, low platelet count, [[fever]], and infection. Clofarabine can also cause [[tachycardia]] and can affect the [[liver]] and [[kidneys]].

    <title>Sitagliptin</title>

Side effects are as common with sitagliptin (whether used alone or with [[metformin]] or [[pioglitazone]]) as they were with [[placebo]], except for rare [[nausea]] and [[common cold]]-like symptoms, including photosensitivity. In those taking [[sulphonylurea]]s, the risk of [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugar]] is increased.

The existence of rare case reports of renal failure and hypersensitivity reactions is noted in the United States prescribing information, but a causative role for sitagliptin has not been established.  One study with lab rats published in 2009 concluded that some of the possible risks of pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer may be reduced when it is used with metformin. However, while DPP-4 inhibitors showed an increase in such risk factors, as of 2009, no increase in pancreatic cancer has been reported in individuals taking DPP-4 inhibitors.

The updated (August 2015) prescribing information cautions that multiple [[Postmarketing surveillance|postmarketing reports]] have been made of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients receiving sitagliptin. Merck notes:

{{quote|Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of JANUVIA as monotherapy and/or in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, cutaneous vasculitis, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome; hepatic enzyme elevations; acute pancreatitis, including fatal and nonfatal hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis; worsening renal function, including acute renal failure (sometimes requiring dialysis); severe and disabling arthralgia; constipation; vomiting; headache; myalgia; pain in extremity; back pain; pruritus; pemphigoid.}}

In 2015, FDA added a new Warning and Precaution about the risk of &quot;severe and disabling&quot; joint pain to the labels of all DPP-4 Inhibitor medicines. In addition to sitagliptin, other DPP-4 inhibitors such as saxagliptin, linagliptin, and alogliptin must also carry the new FDA Warning and Precaution label.

    <title>Terbinafine</title>

Many side effects and [[adverse drug reactions]] have been reported with oral terbinafine hydrochloride possibly due to its extensive [[biodistribution]] and the often extended durations involved in antifungal treatment (longer than two months). A comprehensive list of adverse events associated with terbinafine use includes:
* Gastrointestinal problems: [[Diarrhea]], [[constipation]], [[nausea]], fullness, abdominal pain, [[indigestion]], [[dyspepsia]], [[gastritis]], [[cholestasis]], [[flatulence]], altered stool colour, abdominal muscular pain
* Central nervous system or neurological problems: [[Headaches]], [[dizziness]], [[vertigo]], light-headedness, decreased concentration levels, paraesthesia (pins and needles)
* Hepatic problems: Raised liver enzyme levels, liver [[inflammation]] ([[hepatitis]]), liver damage, liver failure
* Immune system problems: Decreased [[white blood cell]] counts including [[pancytopenia]], [[leukopenia]], [[lymphopenia]], [[thrombocytopenia]], [[agranulocytosis]], and [[neutropenia]],  [[autoimmune]] reactions such as [[lupus erythematosus]]
* Psychological problems: [[Depression (mood)|Depression]], [[anxiety]], [[insomnia]], increased or unusual [[dream]] activity, [[malaise]]
* Sensory problems: Complete loss of taste ([[ageusia]]), decreased taste ([[hypogeusia]]) and distorted taste ([[dysgeusia]]), often involving a metallic taste sensation and dry mouth, visual disturbances including blurred vision, green vision and double vision. In extremely rare cases, the loss or impairment of taste is permanent 
* Skin problems: [[Rashes]], [[hives]] ([[urticaria]]), skin irritation, itching, [[jaundice]], [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]]
* Other side effects: [[Fatigue (medical)|Fatigue]], increased heart rate ([[tachycardia]]), hair loss ([[alopecia]]), decreased [[red blood cell]] count ([[anemia]]), muscle pain ([[myalgia]]), joint pain ([[arthralgia]])

In 2015 physicians reported that a patient with an [[MTHFR]] enzyme mutation (specifically the [[C677T]] variant) had developed an adverse reaction to Lamisil (headache, fatigue, and dizziness). Genetic testing revealed the MTHFR C677T mutation. It was noted that Lamisil interferes with the methylation cycle and that this can cause side effects in individuals with the MTHFR C677T mutation.

Atenolol was the main β-blocker identified as carrying a higher risk of provoking [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]], leading to its downgrading in the United Kingdom in June 2006 to fourth-line agent in the management of hypertension.

===Overdose===
Symptoms of [[overdose]] are due to excessive pharmacodynamic actions on  and also -receptors. These include [[bradycardia]] (slow heartbeat), severe [[hypotension]] with [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], acute [[heart failure]], [[hypoglycemia]] and bronchospastic reactions. Treatment is largely symptomatic. Hospitalization and intensive monitoring is indicated. [[Activated charcoal]] is useful to absorb the drug. [[Atropine]] will counteract bradycardia, [[glucagon]] helps with hypoglycemia, [[dobutamine]] can be given against hypotension and the inhalation of a -mimetic as [[hexoprenalin]] or [[salbutamol]] will terminate bronchospasms. Blood or plasma atenolol concentrations may be measured to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Plasma levels are usually less than 3&amp;nbsp;mg/L during therapeutic administration, but can range from 3–30&amp;nbsp;mg/L in overdose victims.

    <title>Flunoxaprofen</title>

A structural analog of flunoxaprofen is [[benoxaprofen]]. The two drugs are carboxylic acid analogs that form reactive acyl glucurnonides. Benoxaprofen  has been shown to be involved in rare hepatotoxicity. Because of this, benoxaprofen has been removed from the market. In response to this the clinical use of flunoxaprofen has also stopped, even though studies have shown that flunoxaprofen is less toxic than benoxaprofen.

The toxicity of these [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s may be related to the covalent modification of proteins in response to the drugs' reactive acyl glucuronides. The reactivity of the acyl glucoronides can affect the protein binding.

    <title>Polyestradiol phosphate</title>

{{See also|Estradiol (medication)#Side effects}}

[[Clinical study|Systematic studies]] of the [[side effect]]s of PEP are lacking. However, its side effects are assumed to be identical to those of [[estradiol (medication)|estradiol]] and other [[estradiol ester]]s. The side effects of PEP are partially dependent on sex. Common or frequent (&gt;10%) side effects are considered to include [[headache]], [[abdominal pain]], [[nausea]], [[rash]], [[pruritus]], [[loss of libido]], [[erectile dysfunction]], [[breast tenderness]], [[gynecomastia]], [[feminization (biology)|feminization]], [[demasculinization]], [[infertility]], and [[vaginal bleeding|vaginal bleeding or spotting]]. Side effects that occur occasionally or uncommonly (0.1–1%) include [[sodium retention|sodium]] and [[water retention (medicine)|water retention]], [[edema]], [[hypersensitivity]], [[breast tension]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[dizziness]], [[visual disturbance]]s, [[palpitation]]s, [[dyspepsia]], [[erythema nodosum]], [[urticaria]], and [[chest pain]]. All other side effects of PEP are considered to be rare.

The rare (&lt;0.1%) side effects of PEP are considered to include [[weight gain]], [[impaired glucose tolerance]], [[mood (psychology)|mood]] changes ([[mood elation|elation]] or [[depression (mood)|depression]]), [[anxiety|nervousness]], [[tiredness]], [[headache]], [[migraine]], intolerance of [[contact lense]]s, [[hypertension]], [[thrombosis]], [[thrombophlebitis]], [[thromboembolism]], [[heart failure]], [[myocardial infarction]], [[vomiting]], [[bloating]], [[cholestatic jaundice]], [[cholelithiasis]], transient increases in [[transaminase]]s and [[bilirubin]], [[erythema multiforme]], [[hyperpigmentation]], [[muscle cramp]]s, [[dysmenorrhea]], [[vaginal discharge]], [[premenstrual syndrome|premenstrual-like symptoms]], [[breast enlargement]], [[testicular atrophy]], [[allergic reaction]]s (e.g., [[urticaria]], [[bronchial asthma]], [[anaphylactic shock]]) due to [[mepivacaine]], and [[injection site reaction]]s (e.g., [[pain]], [[sterile abscess]]es, [[inflammatory infiltrate]]s).

As [[thromboembolism|thromboembolic]] and other [[cardiovascular]] complications are associated mainly with [[synthetic compound|synthetic]] [[oral administration|oral]] estrogens like [[ethinylestradiol]] and [[diethylstilbestrol]], they occur much less often with [[parenteral]] bioidentical forms of estrogen like PEP.

The most common side effects of fingolimod have been head colds, headache, and fatigue. A few cases of skin cancer have been reported, which has also been reported in patients taking [[natalizumab]] (Tysabri), an approved MS drug. Fingolimod has also been associated with potentially fatal infections, bradycardia and, recently, a case of hemorrhaging focal [[encephalitis]], an inflammation of the brain with bleeding. Two people died: one due to brain herpes infection, and a second one due to [[zoster]]. It is unclear whether the drug was responsible for the events. At least three cases of [[progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy]] had also occurred as of 2015.

Fingolimod has also been known to cause [[macular edema]], resulting in decreased vision.

The [[European Medicines Agency]] has advised doctors to increase their level of monitoring of people after the first dose of the medicine. This includes electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring before treatment and then continuously for the first six hours after the first dose, and measurement of blood pressure and heart rate every hour.

The literature data on the acute toxicity profile of hydroxocobalamin show it is generally regarded as safe with local and systemic exposure. The ability of hydroxocobalamin to rapidly scavenge and detoxify cyanide by chelation has resulted in several acute animal and human studies using systemic hydroxocobalamin doses at suprapharmacological doses as high as 140&amp;nbsp;mg/kg to support its use as an [[intravenous]] (IV) treatment for cyanide exposure. The US FDA at the end of 2006 approved the use hydroxocobalamin as an injection for the treatment of cyanide poisoning.

===From oral and intravenous administration===
Side effects can be severe and include infection, cardiac damage, [[hypertension]], blurred vision, liver and [[kidney]] problems (tacrolimus [[nephrotoxicity]]),

====Carcinogenesis and mutagenesis====
In people receiving immunosuppressants to reduce transplant graft rejection, an increased risk of malignancy (cancer) is a recognised complication. The most common cancers are [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]]{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} and skin cancers. The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of treatment.

===From topical use===
The most common adverse events associated with the use of topical tacrolimus ointments, especially if used over a wide area, include a burning or itching sensation on the initial applications, with increased sensitivity to sunlight and heat on the affected areas. Less common are [[flu-like symptoms]], headache, cough, and burning eyes.

====Cancer risks====
{{further|Eczema#Medications}}
Tacrolimus and a related drug for eczema ([[pimecrolimus]]) were suspected of carrying a cancer risk, though the matter is still a subject of controversy. The FDA issued a health warning in March 2005 for the drug, based on animal models and a small number of patients. Until further human studies yield more conclusive results, the FDA recommends that users be advised of the potential risks. However, current practice by [[United Kingdom|UK]]  dermatologists  is not to consider this a significant real concern and they are increasingly recommending the use of these new drugs.

    <title>Chlorprothixene</title>

Chlorprothixene has a strong sedative activity with a high incidence of [[anticholinergic]] side effects. The types of side effects encountered (dry mouth, massive [[hypotension]] and [[tachycardia]], [[hyperhidrosis]], substantial weight gain etc.) normally do not allow a full effective dose for the remission of psychotic disorders to be given. So cotreatment with another, more potent, antipsychotic agent is needed.

Chlorprothixene is structurally related to [[chlorpromazine]], with which it shares, in principle, all side effects. Allergic side effects and liver damage seem to appear with an appreciable lower frequency. The elderly are particularly sensitive to anticholinergic side effects of chlorprothixene (precipitation of narrow angle [[glaucoma]], severe obstipation, difficulties in urinating, confusional and delirant states). In patients &gt;60 years the doses should be particularly low.

Early and late [[Extrapyramidal symptoms|extrapyramidal side effects]] may occur but have been noted with a low frequency (one study with a great number of participants has delivered a total number of only 1%).

[[Adverse drug reaction|Side effect]]s were rarely reported with sertaconazole therapy, but may include [[contact dermatitis]], burning on application site and skin dryness.

    <title>Ziprasidone</title>

Ziprasidone received a [[black box warning]] due to increased mortality in elderly patients with [[dementia]]-related [[psychosis]]. [[Extrapyramidal symptoms]] are also common and include tremor, [[dystonia]] (sustained or repetitive muscle contractions), [[akathisia]] (the feeling of a need to be in motion), [[parkinsonism]], and muscle rigidity; in a 2013 meta-analysis of 15 antipsychotic drugs, ziprasidone ranked 8th for such side effects.

Recently, the FDA required the manufacturers of some atypical antipsychotics to include a warning about the risk of [[hyperglycemia]] and [[Type II diabetes]] with atypical antipsychotics. Some evidence suggests that ziprasidone does not cause [[insulin resistance]] to the degree of other atypical antipsychotics, such as [[Zyprexa]]. Weight gain is also less of a concern with Ziprasidone compared to other atypical antipsychotics. According to the manufacturer insert, ziprasidone caused an average weight gain of 2.2&amp;nbsp;kg (4.8&amp;nbsp;lbs), which is significantly lower than other atypical antipsychotics, making this medication better for patients that are concerned about their weight.
In December 2014, the FDA warned that ziprasidone could cause a potentially fatal skin reaction, [[Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms]], although this was believed to occur only rarely.

===Discontinuation===
The [[British National Formulary]] recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotic treatment to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse.

    <title>Rasagiline</title>

The FDA label contains warnings that rasagiline may cause severe [[hypertension]] or [[hypotension]], may make people sleepy, may make motor control worse in some people, may cause hallucinations and psychotic-like behavior, may cause [[impulse control disorder]], may increase the risk of [[melanoma]], and upon withdrawal may cause high fever or confusion.

Side effects when the drug is taken alone include flu-like symptoms, joint pain, depression, stomach upset, headache, dizziness, and insomnia. When taken with [[L-DOPA]], side effects include increased movement problems, accidental injury, sudden drops in blood pressure,  joint pain and swelling, dry mouth, rash, abnormal dreams and digestive problems including vomiting, loss of appetite, weight loss, abdominal pain, nausea, constipation.  When taken with Parkinson's drugs other than L-DOPA, side effects include peripheral edema, fall, joint pain, cough, and insomnia.

===Interactions===
People who are taking [[meperidine]], [[tramadol]], [[methadone]], [[propoxyphene]], [[dextromethorphan]], [[St. John’s wort]], [[cyclobenzaprine]], or another  [[MAO inhibitor]] should not take rasagiline.

The FDA drug label carries a warning of the risk of [[serotonin syndrome]] when rasagiline is used with antidepressants or with [[meperidine]].  However the risk appears to be low, based on a multicenter retrospective study in 1504 people, which looked for serotonin syndrome in people with PD who were treated with rasagiline plus antidepressants, rasagiline without antidepressants, or antidepressants plus Parkinson's drugs other than either rasagiline or selegiline; no cases were identified.

There is a risk of psychosis or bizarre behavior if rasagiline is used with dextromethorphan and there is a risk of non-selective MAO inhibition and hypertensive crisis if rasagiline is used with other [[MAOI|MAO inhibitors]].

Adverse effects are dose dependent.  The most common include dizziness, blurred or double vision, fatigue, headaches, nausea, vomiting, sleepiness, and difficulty in concentration and mental sluggishness.

Other rare side effects of oxcarbazepine include severe [[hyponatremia|low blood sodium]], anaphylaxis / angioedema, hypersensitivity (especially if experienced with [[carbamazepine]], [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]], [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]], and thoughts of suicide.

Measurement of serum sodium levels should be considered in maintenance treatment or if symptoms of hyponatremia develop. Some side effects (such as headache) are more pronounced shortly after a dose is taken and tend to fade with the passage of time (60 to 90 minutes). Other side effects include stomach pain, tremor, rash, diarrhea, constipation, decreased appetite and dry mouth. Photosensitivity is a potential side-effect and people could experience severe [[sunburn]]s as a result of sun exposure.

    <title>Cytarabine</title>

One of the unique toxicities of cytarabine is [[cerebellar]] toxicity when given in high doses, which may lead to [[ataxia]].  Cytarabine may cause [[granulocytopenia]] and other impaired body defenses, which may lead to infection, and [[thrombocytopenia]], which may lead to [[hemorrhage]].

Toxicity:  [[leukopenia]], thrombocytopenia, [[anemia]], GI disturbances, [[stomatitis]], [[conjunctivitis]], [[pneumonitis]], [[fever]], and [[dermatitis]], [[Chemotherapy-induced acral erythema|palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia]].  Rarely, [[myelopathy]] has been reported after high dose or frequent [[intrathecal]] Ara-C administration.

When used in protocols designated as high dose, cytarabine can cause cerebral and cerebellar dysfunction, ocular toxicity, pulmonary toxicity, severe GI ulceration and [[peripheral neuropathy]] (rare).

To prevent the side effects and improve the therapeutic efficiency, various derivatives of these drugs (including amino acid, peptide, fatty acid and phosphates) have been evaluated, as well as different delivery systems.

Prolonged use of this medicine on extensive areas of skin, broken or raw skin, skin folds, or underneath airtight dressings may on rare occasions result in enough corticosteroid being absorbed to have side effects on other parts of the body; for example, by causing a decrease in the production of natural hormones by the [[adrenal gland]]s.

Betamethasone is also used prior to delivery of a [[preterm]] baby to help prepare the lungs for breathing. However, because betamethasone crosses the placenta, which is required for its beneficial effects, it may also be associated with complications, such as [[hypoglycemia]] and [[neutrophil leukocytosis|leukocytosis]] in newborns exposed ''[[in utero]]''.

When injected into the [[epidural space]] or the spine, it may cause serious side effects like loss of vision, stroke, and paralysis.

    <title>Prasterone</title>

Prasterone is produced naturally in the human body, but the long-term effects of its use are largely unknown. In the short term, several studies have noted few adverse effects. In a study by Chang ''et al.'', prasterone was administered at a dose of 200&amp;nbsp;mg/day for 24 weeks with slight [[androgenic]] effects noted. Another study utilized a dose up to 400&amp;nbsp;mg/day for 8 weeks with few adverse events reported. A longer term study followed patients dosed with 50&amp;nbsp;mg of prasterone for 12 months with the number and severity of side effects reported to be small. Another study delivered a dose of 50&amp;nbsp;mg of prasterone for 10 months with no serious adverse events reported.

As a hormone precursor, there have been reports of side effects possibly caused by the hormone metabolites of prasterone. and [[stroke]]. Prasterone may stimulate tumor growth in types of cancer that are sensitive to hormones, such as some types of breast, uterine, and prostate cancer. Prasterone may increase prostate swelling in men with [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]] (BPH), an enlarged prostate gland.

Prasterone is a [[steroid hormone]]. High doses may cause aggressiveness, irritability, trouble sleeping, and the growth of body or facial hair on women. It also may stop menstruation and lower the levels of [[High-density lipoprotein|HDL]] (&quot;good&quot; cholesterol), which could raise the risk of heart disease. Other reported side effects include acne, heart rhythm problems, liver problems, hair loss (from the scalp), and oily skin. It may also alter the body's regulation of blood sugar.

Prasterone may promote [[tamoxifen]] resistance. Patients on hormone replacement therapy may have more estrogen-related side effects when taking prasterone. This supplement may also interfere with other medicines, and potential interactions between it and drugs and herbs are possible.

Prasterone is possibly unsafe for individuals experiencing pregnancy, breastfeeding, hormone sensitive conditions, liver problems, diabetes, depression or mood disorders, [[polycystic ovarian syndrome]] (PCOS), or cholesterol problems.

    <title>Pethidine</title>

The adverse effects of pethidine administration are primarily those of the opioids as a class: nausea, vomiting, sedation, dizziness, diaphoresis, urinary retention, and constipation. Unlike other opioids, it does not cause [[miosis]] because of its anticholinergic properties. Overdose can cause muscle flaccidity, respiratory depression, [[obtundation]], cold and clammy skin, hypotension, and coma. A narcotic antagonist such as [[naloxone]] is indicated to reverse respiratory depression and other effects of pethidine. Serotonin syndrome has occurred in patients receiving concurrent antidepressant therapy with [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] or [[monoamine oxidase inhibitors]]. Convulsive seizures sometimes observed in patients receiving parenteral pethidine on a chronic basis have been attributed to accumumulation in plasma of the metabolite norpethidine (normeperidine). Fatalities have occurred following either oral or intravenous pethidine overdose.

===Interactions===
Pethidine has serious interactions that can be dangerous with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., furazolidone, isocarboxazid, moclobemide, phenelzine, procarbazine, selegiline, tranylcypromine). Such patients may suffer agitation, delirium, headache, convulsions, and/or [[hyperthermia]]. Fatal interactions have been reported including the death of [[Libby Zion]]. It is thought to be caused by an increase in cerebral serotonin concentrations. It is probable that pethidine can also interact with a number of other medications, including muscle relaxants, some [[antidepressant]]s, [[benzodiazepine]]s, and [[ethanol]].

    <title>Propofol</title>

One of propofol's most frequent side effects is pain on injection, especially in smaller veins. This pain arises from activation of the pain receptor, [[TRPA1]], found on sensory nerves and can be mitigated by pretreatment with [[lidocaine]]. Less pain is experienced when infused at a slower rate in a large vein (antecubital fossa). Patients show great variability in their response to propofol, at times showing profound sedation with small doses.

Additional side effects include [[hypotension|low blood pressure]] related to [[vasodilation]], transient [[apnea]] following induction doses, and cerebrovascular effects. Propofol has more pronounced hemodynamic effects relative to many intravenous anesthetic agents.

Diminishing cerebral blood flow, cerebral metabolic oxygen consumption, and [[intracranial pressure]] are also characteristics of propofol administration.  In addition, propofol may decrease [[intraocular pressure]] by as much as 50% in patients with normal intraocular pressure.

A more serious but rare side effect is [[dystonia]]. Mild [[myoclonic]] movements are common, as with other intravenous hypnotic agents. Propofol appears to be safe for use in [[porphyria]], and has not been known to trigger [[malignant hyperpyrexia]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Propofol is also reported to induce [[priapism]] in some individuals, and has been observed to suppress REM sleep stage and to worsen the poor sleep quality in some patients.

As with any other general anesthetic agent, propofol should be administered only where appropriately trained staff and facilities for monitoring are available, as well as proper airway management, a supply of supplemental oxygen, artificial ventilation, and cardiovascular resuscitation.

===Propofol infusion syndrome===
{{Main article|Propofol infusion syndrome}}
Another recently described rare, but serious, side effect is [[propofol infusion syndrome]]. This potentially lethal metabolic derangement has been reported in critically ill patients after a prolonged infusion of high-dose substance in combination with [[catecholamine]]s and/or [[corticosteroid]]s.

    <title>Thalidomide</title>

{{See also|List of thalidomide side effects}}
Thalidomide [[Teratogen|causes birth defects]].

There is a high risk that thalidomide can cause excessive [[Thrombosis|blood clots]]. There is also a high risk that thalidomide can interfere with formation of various kinds of new blood cells, creating a risk of infection via [[neutropenia]], [[leukopenia]], and [[lymphopenia]], and risks that blood will not clot via [[thrombocytopenia]].  There is also a risk of [[anemia]] via lack of red blood cells.  The drug can also damage nerves, causing [[peripheral neuropathy]] that may be irreversible.

Thalidomide has several cardiovascular adverse effects, including risk of [[heart attack]]s, [[pulmonary hypertension]], and changes in heart rhythm including [[syncope (medicine)|syncope]], [[bradycardia]] and [[atrioventricular block]].

It can cause [[liver damage]] and severe skin reactions like [[Stevens-Johnson Syndrome]].  It tends to make people sleepy, which creates risk for driving and operating other machinery.   As it kills cancer cells, it can cause [[tumor lysis syndrome]]. Thalidomide can [[Amenorrhea|prevent menstruation]].

Other than the above, very common (reported in more than 10% of people) adverse effects include tremor, dizziness, tingling, numbness, constipation, and peripheral edema.

Common (reported by 1-10% of people) adverse effects include confusion, depressed mood, reduced coordination, heart failure, difficulty breathing, interstitial lung disease, lung inflammation, vomiting, dry mouth, rashes, dry skin, fever, weakness, and a sense of unwellness.

===Interactions===
There are no expected [[Pharmacokinetics|pharmacokinetic]] interactions between thalidomide and other medicines due to its neutral effects on p-glycoprotein and P450 cytochromes.  It may interact with sedatives due to its sedative action. It may also interact with bradycardic agents due to its bradycardia-inducing effects. The risk of peripheral neuropathy may be increased by concomitant treatment with other agents known to cause peripheral neuropathy.

===Overdose===
As of 2013 eighteen cases of overdoses had been reported with doses of up to 14.4 g without any reported fatalities. No specific antidote for overdoses exists and treatment is purely supportive.
